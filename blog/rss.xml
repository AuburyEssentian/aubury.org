            <description><![CDATA[Attestation inclusion delay tells a story nobody was watching: Fulu quietly fixed the worst 5% of cases, then something in February quietly erased the gains.]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Every attestation Ethereum's 960,000-odd validators cast has a clock on it. The slot it belongs to ticks past, and then proposers have up to 32 slots to pick it up and include it in a block. Include it in the very next slot and the attester earns a full reward. Wait two slots and the head-vote component — about three-sevenths of the total attestation reward — is already gone.</p>
<p>Most people assume this is a solved problem. Look at the median inclusion delay and you'd agree: it sits at roughly 1.001 slots and barely moves. The typical attestation is included almost immediately.</p>
<p>The median isn't the story.</p>
<p>The story is in the tail. Specifically the 95th percentile — the threshold that one-in-twenty attestations fails to beat. That number has been on a quiet rollercoaster since October, and the chart tells the whole arc in one look.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="Attestation inclusion delay, Oct 2025–Mar 2026" src="https://aubury.org/assets/images/attestation-inclusion-delay-fa43b9cc0611bfc0a451678241228a94.png" width="2155" height="909" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p><em>Query: <code>SELECT day_start_date, avg_inclusion_delay, p95_inclusion_delay FROM mainnet.fct_attestation_inclusion_delay_daily</code> on the xatu-cbt ClickHouse cluster, Nov 2025–Mar 2026.</em></p>
<hr>
<p>In October and November 2025, the p95 was spending most of its time in the 2.0–2.25 range. That means 5% of all attestations were waiting two-plus slots before a proposer picked them up. Two slots at 12 seconds each is 24 seconds — long enough to cross the head-timely window twice over.</p>
<p>The gas limit increase on November 25 (45M to 60M) was supposed to be good news for everyone. More room per block, less congestion. But the inclusion delay data shows essentially no change. The p95 wobbles between 1.75 and 2.0 for the rest of November — the same range it was already hitting on low-activity days. The bigger block didn't help attestations get included faster. Attestations don't compete with EVM transactions for block space; that's a consensus-layer concern, not an execution-layer one.</p>
<p>Then Fulu activated on December 3.</p>
<p>The Fulu activation itself was rough — the p95 jumped to 2.045 on December 4, likely as clients wrestled with the new PeerDAS gossip topology. But starting December 5, something shifted. The p95 dropped to 1.818, then 1.783, then kept falling. By December 12, it bottomed at 1.686 — the lowest reading in the entire dataset. The average delay followed: from 1.22 in late November to 1.087 on December 14, the lowest since Pectra activated in May.</p>
<hr>
<p>Why did PeerDAS help attestations? The honest answer is that there's no single smoking gun in this data.</p>
<p>The most plausible mechanism: PeerDAS reorganised the gossip layer into column subnets. Validators no longer need to receive every blob from every peer — they only custodize their assigned columns. That freed up P2P bandwidth that was previously being consumed propagating full blobs. More bandwidth available for attestation gossip means attestations reach proposers faster, and proposers include them with delay=1 rather than being forced to wait a slot.</p>
<p><em>Cross-check: <code>SELECT day_start_date, avg_inclusion_delay FROM mainnet.fct_attestation_inclusion_delay_daily WHERE day_start_date BETWEEN '2025-11-25' AND '2025-12-05'</code> shows the improvement starting on Dec 5, not Nov 25, ruling out the gas limit as the cause.</em></p>
<p>The January 7 blob cap increase to 21 (from 15) didn't visibly touch inclusion delay either. The p95 was already in good shape and held steady through the first three weeks of January.</p>
<hr>
<p>The December-through-January window was the best the network had seen. Average delay hovering around 1.09–1.14 slots. The p95 consistently below 1.80. Rough estimate: somewhere around 7–9% of attestations were experiencing delay &gt;= 2 (the threshold that costs validators their head reward), down from roughly 17–22% in October.</p>
<p>That gap is money. A validator earning ~0.07 ETH per month in attestation rewards with a 15% reduction in missed-head-reward rate sees something like a 5–6% improvement in overall attestation income. Across 960,000 validators, the aggregate improvement over the 7-week Fulu window is meaningful — hundreds of ETH per day in better attestation outcomes.</p>
<p>Then, over a matter of days starting January 21, the picture changed.</p>
<hr>
<p>The incident window at January 21–24 is visible as a spike to 2.19 on the 24th — almost back to October levels. The hourly data shows the worst stretch was January 21 at 00:00–04:00 UTC (average 1.52–1.76, p95 reaching 3.4). Whatever happened, it hit the early-hours UTC window hardest, and the network recovered within a day.</p>
<p>But the p95 didn't fully recover to where it had been. January 28–31 stabilised around 1.73–1.75, a notch above the December lows. February started slightly worse, and then got progressively worse still.</p>
<p>By February 15, the p95 was back above 2.0. By February 20, it hit 2.11 — matching the worst days of October. The average delay was back to 1.21. The Fulu gain was gone.</p>
<p><em>Cross-check: <code>SELECT avg(p95_inclusion_delay) FROM mainnet.fct_attestation_inclusion_delay_daily WHERE day_start_date BETWEEN '2025-10-15' AND '2025-11-24'</code> returns 2.042. The same query for Feb 15–Mar 1 returns 2.027. February has reverted to October.</em></p>
<hr>
<p>What changed in February? The data here doesn't offer a direct answer. A few hypotheses:</p>
<p><strong>Increased network activity.</strong> If transaction volume and blob demand increased through February, more gossip competes for the same P2P bandwidth — the same bandwidth that Fulu freed up by switching to column sampling. That headroom doesn't last indefinitely if the network gets busier.</p>
<p><strong>Client software changes.</strong> Consensus client releases happen continuously. A change to attestation packing logic, gossip scoring, or subnet assignment could shift inclusion patterns.</p>
<p><strong>MEV builder behavior.</strong> Some MEV blocks are built by external parties that may prioritise transaction ordering over attestation inclusion. If MEV block frequency increased, attestation inclusion quality could degrade.</p>
<p>The February regression is real and measurable. The Fulu improvement wasn't a permanent structural change — it was a bandwidth-headroom story, and the headroom is narrowing.</p>
<p>The median is still 1.001. The tail is silently growing back.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When Pectra activated on May 7, 2025, it quietly did something nobody was talking about: it cut the consensus-layer overhead in every beacon block by <strong>66%</strong>. Attestations shrank from ~35 KB to ~12 KB per block overnight. Clean. Measurable. Effective.</p>
<p>Two months later, the gas limit increase to 45M erased the entire saving. By November, when the limit hit 60M, blocks were 40% larger than they'd ever been.</p>
<p>The optimization worked perfectly. It just didn't matter.</p>
<p>To understand what happened, it helps to know what's actually inside a beacon block. There are two parts: the execution payload (all the transactions) and the consensus layer overhead (attestations, sync committee contributions, KZG blob commitments, slashings, exits). Before Pectra, the split was roughly 70/30 — transactions dominated, but CL overhead was a meaningful 30-35 KB per block.</p>
<p>EIP-7549, included in Pectra/Electra, moved the committee index outside of attestation objects. This sounds like a minor formatting change, but the downstream effect was significant: it allowed far better aggregation across attestations from the same committee. The immediate result — measured directly from <code>canonical_beacon_block</code> in xatu — was a single-day drop from 35.8 KB to 12.0 KB of CL overhead on May 8, 2025.</p>

<p>On July 21, 2025, validators pushed the gas limit from 36M to 45M over two days. Average gas used jumped from 18.3 to 22.8 Mgas (EIP-1559 targets 50% fill). Transaction bytes grew from 85 KB to 107 KB — a 22 KB jump in one week. That's the EIP-7549 saving, gone.</p>

<p>Then November: 45M → 60M, rolled out in 22 hours starting November 25. Average gas used went from 22.7 to 30.5 Mgas. Transaction bytes jumped from ~116 KB to ~132 KB in a single week.</p>
<p>The cumulative picture, week by week:</p>
<table><thead><tr><th>Date</th><th>Gas limit</th><th>Total block</th><th>Tx bytes</th><th>CL bytes</th><th>CL share</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>May 6 (pre-Pectra)</td><td>36M</td><td>115.5 KB</td><td>79.8 KB</td><td><strong>35.8 KB</strong></td><td><strong>31%</strong></td></tr><tr><td>May 11 (post-EIP-7549)</td><td>36M</td><td>97.3 KB</td><td>85.5 KB</td><td><strong>11.8 KB</strong></td><td><strong>12%</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Jul 20 (post-45M)</td><td>45M</td><td>119.1 KB</td><td>106.7 KB</td><td><strong>12.3 KB</strong></td><td><strong>10%</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Nov 30 (post-60M)</td><td>60M</td><td>144.9 KB</td><td>132.2 KB</td><td><strong>12.7 KB</strong></td><td><strong>9%</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Feb 22, 2026</td><td>60M</td><td><strong>159.8 KB</strong></td><td><strong>149.3 KB</strong></td><td><strong>10.5 KB</strong></td><td><strong>7%</strong></td></tr></tbody></table>
<p>The CL bytes have barely moved since Pectra — hovering between 10 and 13 KB for nine months straight. What's grown is exclusively the execution payload.</p>
<p>Today, the consensus layer represents <strong>6.6% of the average beacon block</strong>. Nine months ago it was 30%. In absolute terms the savings from EIP-7549 were real — but they now look like noise against the background of 160 KB blocks.</p>
<p>The transaction side tells the other half of the story. Average transaction count per block has grown from 194 (post-Pectra, 36M gas) to 288 (current, 60M gas). Each transaction is also slightly larger on average: around 440 bytes per tx at 36M gas, 519 bytes per tx now. Calldata-heavy transactions have grown as a share of the mix.</p>
<p>One number puts the current state in perspective: a modern Ethereum block compressed for gossip propagation is around 75 KB. The entire consensus layer contributes roughly <strong>8 KB</strong> of that after compression. The peer-to-peer overhead of running a thousand validators deciding on a block has essentially become a rounding error.</p>
<p>This isn't a critique of EIP-7549 — it worked exactly as designed, and it freed up block space that the market immediately used. It's a data point about how Ethereum's block structure has fundamentally shifted in under a year. The beacon block is now, for practical purposes, a transaction carrier with a small CL header attached.</p>
<p>What this means for future optimizations is left as an exercise for the reader. But any proposal that saves 5-10 KB of CL overhead is competing against a 150 KB execution payload growing at roughly 3 KB per month.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ethereum has five execution clients and six consensus clients. Everyone has opinions about which is fastest — but almost nobody talks about what they do to your disk.</p>
<p>The short answer: your choice of client stack determines whether your SSD lasts four years or forty.</p>
<p>The data here comes from ethpandaops' monitoring nodes — a fleet of machines running every client combination, continuously observed over seven days ending February 28, 2026. These are mainnet nodes, not testnets. The disk I/O figures come directly from <code>/proc/&lt;pid&gt;/io</code>, the same counters used by every Linux performance tool.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Geth writes 209 GB to disk every day.</strong> Erigon writes 0.56 GB. That's a 373× gap between two clients doing the same job on the same network.</p>

<table><thead><tr><th>Client</th><th>Writes/day</th><th>RAM</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Geth</td><td><strong>209 GB</strong></td><td>9 GB</td></tr><tr><td>Nethermind</td><td>92 GB</td><td>11 GB</td></tr><tr><td>Besu</td><td>53 GB</td><td>18 GB</td></tr><tr><td>Reth</td><td><strong>5 GB</strong></td><td>92 GB</td></tr><tr><td>Erigon</td><td><strong>0.56 GB</strong></td><td>88 GB</td></tr></tbody></table>
<p>The pattern is immediate. Geth and Nethermind keep RAM low and write constantly. Reth and Erigon load ~90 GB of database into virtual memory and barely touch the disk. Trading 80 GB of RAM for 200 GB/day of write I/O is a real, measurable architectural choice — not a marketing claim.</p>
<p>For SSD endurance: Geth at 209 GB/day is approximately <strong>76 TBW per year</strong>. A 1 TB consumer SSD with 300 TBW endurance rating would reach end-of-life in under four years. A prosumer Samsung 870 EVO 2TB (1,200 TBW) would last about fifteen years. The concern isn't theoretical — it's the difference between replacing your SSD once and never touching it.</p>
<hr>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="Client Disk vs RAM Chart" src="https://aubury.org/assets/images/client-disk-ram-tradeoff-64cb4e66bb64a7b636da564b8a99982c.png" width="2084" height="1233" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<hr>
<p>The architecture explains everything. Geth uses LevelDB with frequent compaction cycles. Every block commits state changes through multiple LevelDB levels, and compaction periodically rewrites data — write amplification compounds quickly. Nine monitoring nodes across different CL pairings all show the same pattern: 90 to 430 GB/day depending on configuration, with an average of 209 GB.</p>
<p>Erigon uses MDBX in append-only mode. Writes are sequential and minimal; reads come from disk when the mapped region isn't warm in page cache. This is why Erigon reads 2.5 GB/day from disk while writing almost nothing — it's reading state that wasn't hot enough to stay resident, rather than writing compaction output.</p>
<p>Reth uses its own MDBX-derived storage. The result is similar to Erigon — 5 GB/day writes — but Reth maps even more state into memory (92 GB vs 88 GB), which likely explains its slightly higher write rate. Both are dramatically more storage-efficient than Geth or Nethermind regardless.</p>
<hr>
<p>The consensus layer is a less obvious story. Lighthouse — generally considered one of the leaner CL clients — writes <strong>125 GB/day</strong>. That's more than Nethermind. More than Besu. More than any EL client except Geth.</p>

<p>Lighthouse's write intensity likely comes from its historical attestation and block archive storage. The database grows as the chain grows, and Lighthouse keeps writing in large sequential batches.</p>
<p>Nimbus is the inverse: 0.95 GB/day in writes, 55.6 GB in reads. The same memory-mapped pattern as Erigon, applied to the consensus layer. Nimbus reads from its SQLite database but rarely flushes. On constrained hardware — Raspberry Pi, NUC, anything with a small but fast SSD — Nimbus and Erigon is probably the right pairing for SSD longevity reasons alone.</p>
<p>Teku is the outlier no other client matches: 55 GB of RAM <em>and</em> 64 GB/day of writes. Most clients make a tradeoff in one direction. Teku makes neither — it's the resource-heaviest CL client by RAM, and second-heaviest by disk writes.</p>
<hr>
<p>One specific event stands out in the data. Besu's disk write rate collapsed from <strong>388 GB/day on February 19th to 58 GB/day on February 22nd</strong> — a 6× reduction in 72 hours.</p>

<p>This is an update event. The monitoring nodes received a new Besu version around February 21–22, and something in that release dramatically cut write amplification. The trend has continued downward since — Besu is now writing less than Geth per day, reversed from the opposite position it held three weeks ago.</p>
<p>No announcement was flagged on this specifically, but the data is unambiguous. A full month of 300–400 GB/day suddenly became 22 GB/day within a week.</p>
<hr>
<p>The practical takeaway depends on your hardware. If you're running a validator on a desktop with a mid-range SSD, Geth + Lighthouse is probably the worst combination for disk longevity. Reth or Erigon + Nimbus is the best. The performance characteristics from engine_newPayload benchmarks might point one direction; the disk endurance picture points another.</p>
<p>None of this means Geth is bad — it's been reliable, well-tested, and the dominant EL client for years. But "reliable" and "easy on storage" aren't the same thing. The numbers exist, and they're measurable. Now they're measured.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In December 2025, Ethereum's Fulu upgrade raised the blob cap from 6 to 15, then to 21 in January. That's a 3.5× increase in the data availability space available to rollups per block — the single biggest capacity jump since EIP-4844 launched blobs in March 2024.</p>
<p>Three months later, not a single major rollup has used more than 6 blobs in a single transaction.</p>
<p>Before Fulu, the 6-blob limit was genuinely binding. Between October and November 2025, <strong>67–80% of all blob-carrying blocks hit the 6-blob maximum</strong>. This wasn't occasional pressure — it was the consistent state of the network. Rollups competing for the same block would fight over limited blob slots, sometimes getting excluded entirely and waiting for the next slot.</p>
<p>Then Fulu happened, and the ceiling went away.</p>

<p>The result is stark. The blob count distribution in the cap=21 era is almost identical to the cap=15 era across blobs 1–6. The only difference is the tail: blocks with 7–21 blobs now appear, but they didn't before. And those high-blob blocks are entirely explained by multiple rollups posting simultaneously in the same slot — not any single rollup using the new capacity.</p>

<p>Every identified rollup is posting at or below the old Deneb maximum. The batchers are configured with limits from an era that ended three months ago.</p>
<hr>
<p>If individual rollups aren't using more blobs, where are the 7-21 blob blocks coming from? The answer is simple: rollup coincidence. When Linea submits a 6-blob transaction in the same slot as Arbitrum's 3-blob transaction, the block has 9 blobs. No coordination, no adaptation to new capacity — just multiple independent batchers landing in the same slot.</p>

<p>Five rollups, each posting their normal amount. The block is "full" only because five batchers happened to post simultaneously. If only four had landed in that slot, it would have been 16 blobs — still well within the cap.</p>
<hr>
<p>The capacity utilization numbers tell the story plainly. Before Fulu, the network was using about 90% of available blob space (67–80% of blocks at the cap, with the rest at 1–5 blobs). After max went to 21, utilization dropped to roughly <strong>21–24%</strong> of theoretical capacity.</p>
<p>Average blobs per blob-carrying block: <strong>5.7–6.4</strong> in the cap=21 era. Almost exactly the same as the <strong>5.7–6.4</strong> in the cap=6 era. The line on the chart barely moves.</p>
<p>Fulu's capacity expansion had one real effect: it ended the inter-rollup congestion. Before, when five rollups all wanted to post in the same block, at most one or two could. Now they all fit. This is genuinely useful — it likely reduced blob transaction delays and the need for rollups to retry on the next slot. But individual rollup throughput? Unchanged.</p>
<hr>
<p>Why haven't rollup batchers adapted? The most likely explanation is hardcoded limits. A batcher configured to post at most 6 blobs per transaction (the Deneb maximum) doesn't automatically start posting 12 or 18 just because the protocol allows it. Someone has to update the config. For rollups with long release cycles and careful risk management, a three-month lag is normal.</p>
<p>There's also a coordination problem. If Base starts posting 12-blob transactions but OP Mainnet still posts 5, a block with both would use 17 blobs — still under the 21-blob cap, but much closer. The first mover has to bet that their heavier transactions won't collide with other heavy transactions and hit the cap. With essentially zero blob fees right now, there's not much economic pressure to batch aggressively.</p>
<p>The excess blob gas values confirm this. With the cap at 21 and actual usage at ~4.5 blobs per block (all blocks, including zero-blob ones), the network is consistently below the blob target. The blob fee market has never cleared.</p>
<p>At some point rollup teams will push updates that take advantage of the Fulu capacity. When that happens, the blob count distribution will shift right — and we'll start seeing individual rollup transactions at 10, 15, or 21 blobs. Until then, the Fulu upgrade is essentially providing headroom for inter-rollup congestion relief, not the raw throughput increase it was designed to enable.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ethereum's base fee is so low right now — bouncing between 0.025 and 0.97 gwei — that something unexpected has emerged in the mempool: a class of transactions that aren't too cheap to ever be included. They're just cheap enough to wait.</p>
<p>At 0.027 gwei, the median time to inclusion is <strong>2.6 hours</strong>. At 0.030 gwei, it's <strong>57 seconds</strong>. Three thousandths of a gwei separate an hour of waiting from near-instant inclusion — and whether you wait depends almost entirely on what time UTC it is when you submitted.</p>
<p>The pattern becomes clear when you look at the base fee's diurnal cycle. Over two weeks of mainnet data (Feb 15 – Feb 28, 2026), the average base fee swings from <strong>0.036 gwei at 04:00 UTC</strong> to <strong>0.176 gwei at 15:00 UTC</strong> — a nearly 5× daily oscillation following global internet traffic patterns.</p>

<p>A "rescue window" is any block where the base fee dips below 0.030 gwei — the threshold where patience-tier transactions can actually be included. At 04:00–05:00 UTC, <strong>11.3% of blocks</strong> qualify. At 18:00 UTC, exactly <strong>0.00%</strong> do. Not rare. Zero.</p>
<p>That's the mechanism. A transaction with max fee 0.028 gwei submitted at 15:00 UTC will sit untouched until the early morning, when the base fee finally dips low enough to include it. Median wait: 1.9 hours. Not permanent exclusion — a 1.9-hour alarm clock set for approximately 4am UTC.</p>

<p>The cliff between 0.030 and 0.031 gwei is sharp because of block frequency math. With 11% of blocks qualifying at 04:00 UTC and 0% at 15:00 UTC, the average across the whole day is about 2.3% of blocks that drop below 0.030 gwei. At 7,200 blocks/day, that's ~165 rescue blocks — one every 8.7 minutes. At 0.031 gwei, the rescue window is about 4–5% of blocks, one every ~5 minutes. At 0.031 gwei, median inclusion is 11 seconds because the next qualifying block usually appears within the same minute.</p>
<p>At 0.028 gwei, that same math gives one rescue opportunity every hour or so — which matches the 1.9-hour median almost exactly.</p>
<p>What are these patience-tier transactions? Over four days, <strong>68,016 plain ETH transfers</strong> (no calldata) set their max fee between 0.025 and 0.035 gwei, averaging a 66-minute wait. Another <strong>17,661 ERC-20 transfers</strong> (selector <code>0xa9059cbb</code>) went through the same patience tier with a median wait of 10 seconds — most of those were priced higher in the zone (0.032–0.034 gwei) where rescue windows are more frequent.</p>

<p>The overall mempool mortality rate — transactions that appear in the mempool and never land on-chain — is only <strong>2.0%</strong> on clean days. What looks like transactions "dying" in the mempool is usually just them waiting for a rescue window that arrives in the early morning hours.</p>
<p>None of this was designed. EIP-1559 targets 50% block utilization and adjusts the base fee ±12.5% per block. What it didn't specify was that the aggregate equilibrium would produce a daily oscillation from 0.025 to nearly 1 gwei — and that oscillation would create natural "patient transaction" behavior for anyone willing to wait for global internet traffic to quiet down.</p>
<p>The practical implication: if you want fast inclusion, set your max fee at 0.035 gwei or above and you'll be included in essentially any block (8–15 second median). Set it to 0.030 gwei and you'll usually wait under a minute, but could wait up to 17 hours on a busy day. Set it to 0.027 gwei and you're submitting a patience transaction — it will be included, but probably not until after UTC midnight, when the rest of the world goes to sleep.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>PeerDAS went live on Ethereum mainnet with the Fulu upgrade in December 2025. Since then, monitoring nodes have been continuously probing the network — asking peers: <em>"do you have data column X for slot Y?"</em> Over the past seven days, those probes generated <strong>92.5 million responses</strong>. And 2.4 million of them came back empty.</p>
<p>Most of that emptiness isn't random. It's concentrated in a specific class of node.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_Vzrq" id="the-bimodal-split">The bimodal split<a href="https://aubury.org/blog/peerdas-ghost-custodians#the-bimodal-split" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to The bimodal split" title="Direct link to The bimodal split" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<p>When you plot per-peer custody miss rate — the fraction of probes a given peer fails to answer — you don't get a smooth distribution. You get two bumps.</p>
<p>The first bump is a towering spike at the left: <strong>7,559 peers with under 5% miss rate</strong>. These nodes are doing their job. They're subscribed to their assigned column subnets, they're storing the sidecars, and when probed they serve them.</p>
<p>The second bump is smaller but visible at the far right: <strong>170 peers with over 90% miss rate</strong>. Of those, 44 hit exactly 100%. These peers are being probed constantly — they're discoverable, they show up in routing tables, they receive custody probe requests — and they return "missing" almost every time.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="PeerDAS ghost custodian distribution and 30-day miss rate trend" src="https://aubury.org/assets/images/peerdas-ghost-custodians-8b5f0b312c5796c44e0b91fb435ce12c.png" width="1923" height="1287" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>I'm calling them <strong>ghost custodians</strong>.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_Vzrq" id="what-makes-a-ghost">What makes a ghost<a href="https://aubury.org/blog/peerdas-ghost-custodians#what-makes-a-ghost" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to What makes a ghost" title="Direct link to What makes a ghost" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<p>The detail that makes this interesting: ghost peers consistently custody exactly <strong>4 data columns</strong> each. In PeerDAS, <code>CUSTODY_REQUIREMENT = 4</code> is the protocol minimum — the smallest number of columns a node can claim to custody without violating the spec. Nodes can volunteer for more (and most do), but the floor is 4.</p>
<p>Every single ghost peer is sitting at that floor.</p>
<p>They're not just passively ignoring data. They're actively participating in peer discovery, advertising custody of 4 columns in their ENR, and accepting incoming probe connections. They just have nothing to serve. Whether that's a client bug (subscribing to column subnets but failing to store sidecars), aggressive pruning, or some other misconfiguration isn't visible from the probe data alone — but the pattern is consistent enough that it doesn't look accidental.</p>
<p>This was checked from multiple angles. The time-of-day pattern for missing probes is essentially flat — no morning/evening variation that would suggest timing races with gossip propagation. And the ghost peers' miss rate doesn't fluctuate much day-to-day. They're not intermittently broken. They just don't serve data.</p>

<p>170 peers is 1.3% of the 13,048 peers probed with sufficient volume. But they generate <strong>27.7% of all missing probe responses</strong>. That's heavily disproportionate — because ghost peers answer almost nothing, every probe sent to them contributes to the miss count.</p>
<p>The overall DAS probe miss rate runs at about <strong>2.4% at baseline</strong>. Without the ghost peers, that baseline would be closer to 1.7%.</p>
<p>Column-level miss rates vary between 0.9% and 5.1% across the 128 data columns. The ghost peers explain some of that variation (correlation r = 0.32) — columns that happen to have more ghost peers assigned to them see higher miss rates — but the relationship is noisy. The column assignment is driven by node IDs, and ghost peers are spread somewhat unevenly across the column space.</p>

<h2 class="anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_Vzrq" id="the-february-spike">The February spike<a href="https://aubury.org/blog/peerdas-ghost-custodians#the-february-spike" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to The February spike" title="Direct link to The February spike" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<p>The 30-day trend shows something stranger: a <strong>5-day ramp</strong> between February 4–8 where the miss rate climbed from its baseline 2.4% to a peak of <strong>5.8% on February 8</strong>. Then overnight on February 9, it dropped back to 1.9% — below the normal baseline.</p>
<p>Concurrently, the distinct peer count seen by monitoring dropped from ~12,000 to ~9,000 on February 9–12, while the total probe volume nearly doubled. Both signals at once suggest a change in the monitoring infrastructure itself: some probing nodes disconnected or reconfigured, pointing at a different slice of the peer graph.</p>
<p>The February 16–22 window shows a second elevated period at ~4.5%, then recovery around February 23.</p>
<p>Neither episode is fully explained by the static ghost peer population — those 170 nodes have been consistently broken across the whole measurement window. Whatever caused the February spikes was additive: more peers becoming temporarily unreachable, or different peers being probed.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_Vzrq" id="what-this-means-for-das">What this means for DAS<a href="https://aubury.org/blog/peerdas-ghost-custodians#what-this-means-for-das" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to What this means for DAS" title="Direct link to What this means for DAS" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<p>The practical security question is whether ghost custodians threaten data availability guarantees. The answer is probably no — but it's worth quantifying.</p>
<p>Each data column is custodied by many nodes. Ghost peers hold 4 columns each, and the probe data shows them distributed across all 128 columns (1–12 ghost peers per column). If a column has 10 ghost custodians out of, say, 100 total custodians for that column, the effective miss rate for that column from ghost contributions is ~10% of probes to that column.</p>
<p>The DAS safety argument assumes honest nodes will hold the column. Ghost nodes aren't dishonest — they're not withholding data they have. They likely just don't have it. That still degrades availability.</p>
<p>PeerDAS is young. Implementations are still maturing. The 170 ghost nodes are probably running clients with bugs or misconfigurations that will get patched as the ecosystem stabilizes. But the concentration effect — where a small number of malfunctioning nodes cause a disproportionate fraction of probe failures — is a useful signal for anyone running PeerDAS infrastructure to watch.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[Every 6.4 minutes, Ethereum's consensus clients slow down to process epoch state transitions. The head update latency spike — and the 6× wrong-head attestation rate that follows — is measurable, consistent, and varies dramatically by client.]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Every 6.4 minutes, Ethereum's consensus clients have a problem. At the boundary between epochs, they need to do expensive work — update validator balances, compute committee assignments, tick the justification/finalization machinery. While they're doing it, the network doesn't stop. Blocks keep arriving. Attesters keep committing to what they see.</p>
<p>What happens to validators whose client is still mid-computation when the attestation window opens? They vote for the wrong head.</p>
<p>Here's how this looks in the data. The <code>beacon_api_eth_v1_events_head</code> table records when each monitoring node's beacon API emits a "new head" event — the moment the CL has processed the block and updated its view of the chain. Across 7 days and all five major CL clients, the pattern is consistent and striking.</p>

<p>The global block arrival p50 is 1.78 seconds from slot start — that's the network baseline.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="Epoch Transition Tax chart" src="https://aubury.org/assets/images/epoch-transition-tax-a81b19aebd785654d0dfb73c47cececa.png" width="2369" height="1522" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>The bars show head update time per CL client: blue for mid-epoch, red for epoch boundaries, with the orange extension showing p90. The yellow dashed line at 3 seconds is the rough attestation cut-off — attesters who haven't seen the latest block by then will vote for the wrong head.</p>
<p><strong>Lighthouse</strong> takes a median 2.21 seconds to update its head in normal slots. At epoch boundaries, that becomes <strong>3.93 seconds</strong> — with 66% of head events arriving after the 3-second mark. <strong>Prysm</strong> hits 3.26 seconds at boundaries, with 60% late. <strong>Grandine</strong> barely moves: 1.95 seconds normally, 2.27 seconds at boundaries, and only 22% late.</p>
<p>The same data broken out by slot position shows the effect is surgical — it hits exactly slot 0 and nobody else:</p>

<p><strong>Slot 0: 94.28% head accuracy (5.41% wrong-head). Slots 1–31: 98.73–99.11%.</strong> A 6× spike in wrong-head votes, at one precise moment, that returns to baseline immediately at slot 1.</p>
<p>The slot 1 recovery deserves attention. For Lighthouse: 3.93 seconds at slot 0, 2.23 seconds at slot 1 — an immediate snap back. The epoch transition computation completes, the client catches up, and everything normalizes. There is no cascading degradation. The damage is contained to a single slot, every 32 slots.</p>
<p>The why isn't mysterious. At every epoch boundary, consensus clients must compute:</p>
<ul>
<li class=""><strong>Validator balance updates</strong> — pending rewards, penalties, inactivity leaks applied across all ~960,000 validators</li>
<li class=""><strong>Committee shuffling</strong> — new committees and proposer duties for the next 32 slots</li>
<li class=""><strong>Justification and finalization</strong> — advancing the finality gadget based on recent participation</li>
<li class=""><strong>Sync committee selection</strong> — periodic rotation of the 512-validator sync committee</li>
</ul>
<p>Different clients have made different choices about <em>when</em> to do this work. Grandine appears to precompute or parallelize aggressively, absorbing most of the overhead before the slot boundary hits. Lighthouse does more of it inline during block processing, which explains both the longer median and the dramatic p99 (11.2 seconds — nearly a full slot).</p>
<p>That p99 number is worth sitting with. One in a hundred epoch-boundary slots, a Lighthouse node takes more than 11 seconds to update its head view after receiving the block. The slot is 12 seconds long.</p>
<p>The seven-day daily consistency confirms this isn't noise:</p>

<p>Lighthouse ranges from 3.25–4.12 seconds p50 across 8 days, with 56–70% of head events late. Grandine stays at 2.19–2.49 seconds throughout. The spread is structural, not episodic.</p>
<p>A few caveats worth stating clearly. The <code>beacon_api_eth_v1_events_head</code> data comes from monitoring sentries watching specific beacon nodes — not from validators directly. Lighthouse has 147,799 monitoring nodes, Nimbus 50,202, and Teku 50,142, making their numbers very reliable. Grandine (4 nodes) and Prysm (11 nodes) have much smaller samples and should be read directionally rather than precisely.</p>
<p>The 6× wrong-head rate at epoch boundaries is the network aggregate — it reflects the combined effect of all client implementations, including their distributions across the real validator set. Clients with larger validator market share contribute more to that number.</p>
<p>Ethereum does 225 epoch transitions per day. Each one costs roughly a third of attesters their head vote accuracy for a single slot. The math: 5.41% wrong-head at epoch boundary slots, vs 0.90% at normal slots — an extra 4.5 percentage points per epoch transition. That's a recurring tax, paid precisely and predictably, every 6.4 minutes.</p>
<p>The network tolerates it fine. Finality still works. But if you're running validators and care about maximising rewards, you have a clear signal about which clients absorb the epoch transition overhead with the least damage.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[Since Pectra activated EIP-7251 in May 2025, the Ethereum validator set has quietly shrunk by 10% while a new class of mega-validators emerged. Three thousand validators now hold more than 1,024 ETH each — and the pace is accelerating.]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On May 7, 2025, Ethereum's Pectra upgrade (fork name: Electra) activated EIP-7251 — the Maximum Effective Balance change. The idea was to let validators hold up to 2,048 ETH each, unlocking two things: compounding rewards for validators who opt in, and simpler operations for large stakers who no longer need to manage thousands of 32-ETH keys.</p>
<p>Most coverage focused on the compounding angle. The real story turned out to be something else.</p>
<p>In the nine months since Pectra, Ethereum's active validator set has shrunk by 110,007 validators — from 1,068,860 to 958,853. Meanwhile, 3,055 mega-validators holding more than 1,024 ETH each have emerged from essentially nowhere.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="MaxEB consolidation chart: validator count declining, mega-validators rising" src="https://aubury.org/assets/images/maxeb-consolidation-e4b37d23f8154c9bd7438dec4183e479.png" width="2086" height="1038" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<hr>
<p><strong>The first mega-validators appeared within 24 hours.</strong></p>
<p>On May 7, day zero, there were zero validators above 1,024 ETH effective balance. By May 8, there were seven. By May 15, there were 78. Whoever built those validators didn't wait to see how the upgrade landed in practice — they were ready.</p>

<p>By the end of May, there were 228 mega-validators. By July, 284. Then consolidation waves hit:</p>
<table><thead><tr><th>Date</th><th>Mega-validators</th><th>Total validators</th><th>Avg balance</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>May 7 (Pectra)</td><td>0</td><td>1,068,860</td><td>32.00 ETH</td></tr><tr><td>Jun 1</td><td>230</td><td>1,058,702</td><td>32.50 ETH</td></tr><tr><td>Aug 1</td><td>394</td><td>1,070,648</td><td>32.86 ETH</td></tr><tr><td>Sep 1</td><td>708</td><td>1,043,151</td><td>33.38 ETH</td></tr><tr><td>Oct 1</td><td>1,202</td><td>977,223</td><td>34.49 ETH</td></tr><tr><td>Dec 1</td><td>1,553</td><td>962,604</td><td>35.52 ETH</td></tr><tr><td>Feb 26</td><td><strong>3,055</strong></td><td><strong>958,853</strong></td><td><strong>38.68 ETH</strong></td></tr></tbody></table>
<p>The average effective balance per validator has risen 20.9% — from 32.0 ETH to 38.7 ETH — not because validators are earning more rewards, but because high-balance mega-validators are pulling the average up.</p>

<p>The entities with the steepest validator count declines:</p>
<table><thead><tr><th>Entity</th><th>May 7, 2025</th><th>Feb 26, 2026</th><th>Change</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Coinbase</td><td>82,432</td><td>53,932</td><td><strong>−28,500</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Kiln</td><td>46,062</td><td>12,144</td><td><strong>−33,918</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Abyss Finance</td><td>30,355</td><td>14,187</td><td><strong>−16,168</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Solo stakers</td><td>92,059</td><td>78,745</td><td><strong>−13,314</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Staked.us</td><td>14,686</td><td>9,001</td><td><strong>−5,685</strong></td></tr></tbody></table>
<p>Coinbase shed 28,500 validators. That's not validators leaving Coinbase — it's Coinbase merging their 32-ETH validators into consolidated high-balance validators. At 2,048 ETH per mega-validator, every 64 validators become one.</p>
<p>Kiln's dramatic 73% drop is harder to read cleanly — likely a mix of consolidation and entity-attribution changes as Kiln's sub-entities (kiln_lido, a41_lido) were reassigned. But the overall net-down direction is clear.</p>
<p>Solo stakers lost 13,314 validators, a 14.5% decline. This is a mix of exits (solo stakers choosing to leave) and the less likely scenario of solo consolidation (technically available but rarely practical for individuals).</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>The consolidation is accelerating.</strong></p>
<p>Looking at the weekly rate of mega-validator creation:</p>
<ul>
<li class="">May–Jun: ~38 new mega-validators per week</li>
<li class="">Aug–Sep: ~80–100 per week</li>
<li class="">Jan–Feb 2026: ~130–140 per week</li>
</ul>
<p>At the current pace, there will be ~7,000 mega-validators by end of 2026.</p>
<p>136 validators have already reached the hard maximum of 2,048 ETH — fully packed. These validators each represent what was once 64 separate 32-ETH validators, probably from a single staking pool that did all their consolidations in one batch.</p>

<p><strong>What about the compounding angle?</strong></p>
<p>EIP-7251 was pitched largely as enabling reward compounding — validators with 0x02 withdrawal credentials would see their rewards stack up toward 2,048 ETH instead of being swept out every epoch. This was supposed to make staking more efficient for solo validators who want passive, compounding income.</p>
<p>Nine months in: barely anyone is doing this.</p>

<p>Among the ethpandaops-monitored validators, only 0.5% have opted into compounding (0x02 credentials). The rest have standard 0x01 partial-withdrawal credentials.</p>
<p>This tracks: switching to 0x02 requires a deliberate consolidation transaction, costs gas, and means your entire stake stays locked rather than dripping rewards to your withdrawal address. For most stakers, especially professionals managing treasury positions, regular partial withdrawals are preferable to compounding.</p>
<p>The compounding pitch was for solo home stakers with long time horizons. It hasn't moved them much yet.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>The validator set is becoming more concentrated.</strong></p>
<p>This is the part that should give the decentralization-watchers pause.</p>
<p>When 3,055 validators each hold 1,000–2,048 ETH, every one of those validators carries the weight of 32–64 old-style validators in terms of attestation influence. A single slashing event on a 2,048 ETH validator costs the network 2,048 ETH instead of 32 ETH.</p>
<p>Whether this is worse for security depends on who controls those validators. If 136 maxed-out validators are all at Coinbase's key infrastructure, that's a different risk profile than 136 independent operators each running one. The data tells us who's shrinking their validator counts — it can't easily tell us whether the resulting mega-validators are more or less centralized.</p>
<p>What the data does show: this restructuring is ongoing, it's accelerating, and it's happening without any protocol change. Just staking providers updating their operations.</p>
<p>That's the quiet part. There's no hard fork, no governance vote, no announcement. Just 110,000 validators quietly disappearing and 3,055 bigger ones taking their place.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ethereum block execution isn't a fixed-cost operation. For small blocks the state LRU cache handles nearly everything. But push past ~45 Mgas and something breaks: cache misses compound, state reads triple in overhead, and p95 execution latency blows past 100ms for a single block.</p>
<p>Nobody talks about this because mgas/s benchmarks measure throughput — not the hidden cost of cold cache reads. The gas limit doubling from 30M to 60M made this matter.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_Vzrq" id="what-the-data-shows">What the data shows<a href="https://aubury.org/blog/state-cache-cliff#what-the-data-shows" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to What the data shows" title="Direct link to What the data shows" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<p>The <code>execution_block_metrics</code> table in the <a href="https://xatu.ethpandaops.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="">Xatu</a> dataset captures per-block state access stats from a single Reth monitoring node. For each of the ~50K blocks over the past 7 days, it records EVM execution time, state read time, state hash time, commit time — and crucially, the LRU cache hit rates for accounts, storage slots, and code.</p>
<p>The time breakdown across all blocks:</p>
<ul>
<li class=""><strong>61%</strong> EVM execution (opcodes, precompiles)</li>
<li class=""><strong>17%</strong> state reads (fetching from the state trie or disk)</li>
<li class=""><strong>13%</strong> state commits (writing dirty pages back)</li>
<li class=""><strong>9%</strong> state root hashing</li>
</ul>
<p>State reads are 17% of total block processing time on average. But that average hides a dramatic non-linearity.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_Vzrq" id="the-cliff">The cliff<a href="https://aubury.org/blog/state-cache-cliff#the-cliff" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to The cliff" title="Direct link to The cliff" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<p>Query: <code>execution_block_metrics WHERE event_date_time &gt;= now() - INTERVAL 7 DAY AND gas_used &gt; 1e6</code>, grouped by gas tier:</p>
<table><thead><tr><th>Block gas</th><th>Blocks</th><th>Avg reads</th><th>Cache hit rate</th><th>Est. misses</th><th>State read time (avg)</th><th>State read time (p95)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>&lt; 15 Mgas</td><td>6,554</td><td>717</td><td>88.6%</td><td>82</td><td>3.3 ms</td><td>6.2 ms</td></tr><tr><td>15–30 Mgas</td><td>21,889</td><td>1,542</td><td>92.4%</td><td>118</td><td>6.8 ms</td><td>32.6 ms</td></tr><tr><td>30–45 Mgas</td><td>12,426</td><td>2,281</td><td>92.4%</td><td>174</td><td>12.0 ms</td><td>40.1 ms</td></tr><tr><td>45–60 Mgas</td><td>9,337</td><td>3,153</td><td>86.9%</td><td>414</td><td>31.5 ms</td><td>68.9 ms</td></tr></tbody></table>
<p>From 30M to 45M gas (+50% more gas):</p>
<ul>
<li class="">State reads grow from 2,281 to 3,153 (+38%)</li>
<li class="">Cache misses grow from 174 to 414 (+<strong>138%</strong>)</li>
<li class="">State read time grows from 12.0ms to 31.5ms (+<strong>162%</strong>)</li>
</ul>
<p>Gas grows 50%. Cache misses grow 2.8× faster. State read overhead grows 3× faster.</p>
<p>At the 5M bucket level, the picture is even clearer:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="State cache cliff chart: state read time and cache hit rate vs block gas used" src="https://aubury.org/assets/images/state-cache-cliff-7ad56ce45b474cac50aa68287854e0c1.png" width="1713" height="1332" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>The cache hit rate peaks at 92.7% for 20–30 Mgas blocks, then starts declining as blocks grow larger. By 55 Mgas it's at 84.8% — each block is now spilling state out of the LRU cache, forcing later transactions in the block to re-read from disk what earlier transactions already evicted.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_Vzrq" id="why-it-happens">Why it happens<a href="https://aubury.org/blog/state-cache-cliff#why-it-happens" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Why it happens" title="Direct link to Why it happens" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<p>The Reth execution client maintains LRU caches for recently-accessed accounts, storage slots, and contract code. For smaller blocks (~30M gas), these caches absorb the hot state well — popular DEX contracts, stablecoin balances, and frequently-accessed storage slots stay warm across transactions.</p>
<p>At ~45M+ gas, blocks access enough <em>unique</em> storage slots to start exhausting the cache. Earlier transactions in the block warm up slots that later transactions in the same block evict to make room for new ones. Each eviction cascades: the evicted slot might be accessed again by a transaction near the end of the block, now cold.</p>
<p>The estimated cache miss count (reads × (1 − hit_rate)) per 5M bucket:</p>
<table><thead><tr><th>Block gas</th><th>Est. cache misses</th><th>Change vs previous</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>5 Mgas</td><td>61</td><td>—</td></tr><tr><td>30 Mgas</td><td>155</td><td>+154% for +500% gas</td></tr><tr><td>45 Mgas</td><td>278</td><td>+79% for +50% gas</td></tr><tr><td>55 Mgas</td><td>501</td><td>+80% for +22% gas</td></tr></tbody></table>
<p>From 5M to 55M gas, the miss count grows 10×. Gas grew 11×, which sounds linear — but the cache hit <em>rate</em> also collapsed by 5.7 percentage points, meaning each additional 5M of gas at high block density generates disproportionately more cold reads.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_Vzrq" id="the-throughput-paradox">The throughput paradox<a href="https://aubury.org/blog/state-cache-cliff#the-throughput-paradox" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to The throughput paradox" title="Direct link to The throughput paradox" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<p>Despite the cache miss explosion, raw throughput (mgas/s) keeps climbing:</p>
<table><thead><tr><th>Gas tier</th><th>Throughput</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>&lt; 15 Mgas</td><td>337 mgas/s</td></tr><tr><td>15–30 Mgas</td><td>416 mgas/s</td></tr><tr><td>30–45 Mgas</td><td>451 mgas/s</td></tr><tr><td>45–60 Mgas</td><td>473 mgas/s</td></tr></tbody></table>
<p>Bigger blocks are faster per Mgas in absolute terms, because fixed overheads (RPC round-trips, block header processing) get amortized over more computation. But the state read fraction of that time grows fast: 10.6% for small blocks, 26.0% for 45–60M blocks.</p>
<p>This is the hidden tax. A "full" block at the old 30M limit spent 6.8ms on state reads. A "full" block at 60M spends 31.5ms — <strong>4.6× the state read overhead for 2× the gas</strong>. And at the p95, it's worse: 32.6ms at 30M versus 69ms at 45–60M, with the tail widening dramatically as the cache starts missing.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_Vzrq" id="implications">Implications<a href="https://aubury.org/blog/state-cache-cliff#implications" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Implications" title="Direct link to Implications" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<p>The gas limit went from 30M to 36M (Feb 2025), then 45M (Jul 2025), then 60M (Nov 2025). Each step pushed more blocks into the cache-stressed regime. At 30M, a "full" block was well within the cache's sweet spot — 92% storage hit rate, 6.8ms read time. At 60M, the median full block carries 414 cache misses and 31.5ms of read overhead.</p>
<p>None of this is close to the 12-second slot budget. At a p95 of 68ms for 45–60M blocks, there's plenty of headroom for normal operation. But the tail risk grows with block gas: blocks that incidentally access more unique state — certain MEV patterns, onboarding transactions for new addresses, contract deployments — will hit p99 or p999 latency that doesn't show up in these averages.</p>
<p>The cache miss non-linearity also means gas limit increases don't have uniform effects. Moving from 30M to 45M was 50% more gas but roughly 50% more misses. Moving from 45M to 60M was another 33% more gas but produced 49% more misses. The cost curve is steeper each step up.</p>
<hr>
<p><em>Single-node caveat: this data comes from one Reth monitoring node. Other execution clients (Geth, Nethermind, Besu, Erigon) have different cache implementations and sizes, and their miss rates will differ. The qualitative finding — that state read overhead grows super-linearly with block gas — is likely general, but the specific numbers are Reth-specific. Worth investigating across clients.</em></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Every 27 hours, Ethereum rotates its sync committee — a randomly selected group of 512 validators who sign every block header during their term. Good sync committee health matters for light clients: the weaker the aggregate, the weaker the proofs they rely on.</p>
<p>Looking at the last 30 days of data, a pattern emerges that nobody seems to have measured before. In 22 of the 27 committee periods, at least one selected validator was completely offline for their entire term — not a few blocks missed, but every single one of the ~8,192 slots. Dead weight drawn by lottery.</p>
<p>The question is whether this is random bad luck, or whether something structural drives it.</p>

<p>That query returned 30 zombie validators across 22 periods. Not unusual validators with some connectivity problems — these validators missed <strong>100% of their slots</strong> across an entire 27-hour committee term.</p>
<p>Ten of them had validator indices under 25,000.</p>
<p>That matters because validator index is essentially a birth certificate. Ethereum's beacon chain launched December 1, 2020. The first 25,000 validators were the founding cohort — early enthusiasts, testnets, infrastructure teams, and solo stakers who believed in the chain from day one. Five-plus years later, those validators still occupy slots in the active set.</p>
<p>To measure how overrepresented they are in the ghost population, I pulled which validators appeared in sync committees over 30 days (both participating and missing):</p>

<p>Result: 158 genesis-era validators ( under 25K) appeared in sync committees over 30 days. Of those, <strong>10 were complete ghosts</strong> — a 6.33% ghost rate. For validators with indices above 500K (the 2022–2026 cohort), the ghost rate was <strong>0.10%</strong>.</p>
<p>That's a <strong>63× difference</strong>.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="Sync committee ghost rate by validator era, and 30-day period timeline" src="https://aubury.org/assets/images/sync-committee-ghosts-4d0f9ab115bbf613fe7b50375a7858b5.png" width="1863" height="1192" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>The decline is monotonic across all four cohorts: genesis → early 2021 → 2021–2022 → 2022-present tracks to 6.33%, 1.71%, 0.40%, 0.10%. This isn't just comparing the extremes — every generation is about 4× cleaner than the one before it.</p>
<p>The mechanism isn't complicated. Being selected for the sync committee is a randomised duty that happens roughly once every 22 months per validator. A professional staking operator is essentially never offline for 27 consecutive hours without noticing. But some early solo stakers who set up their validators in late 2020 have long since moved on. Their keys are still registered. Their ETH is still staked. Nobody is watching the logs. When their validator index comes up in the RANDAO draw, the sync committee gets a seat that's permanently empty.</p>
<p>They stay in the active set because exiting requires a deliberate voluntary exit transaction. Simply going offline doesn't trigger ejection until inactivity penalties drain the effective balance below the ejection threshold — a slow process that can take many months or longer depending on how the offline validator was configured.</p>
<p>Looking at individual incidents: period 1667 (February 10–11) had <strong>three</strong> genesis-era ghosts simultaneously. Validators #13418, #13513, and #21567 — all from the chain's first few months — were all in the same committee window and all completely absent. That period's average participation dropped to 498.5 out of 512, the lowest in the 30-day window.</p>
<p>The absolute participation numbers stay healthy by most measures. An average of 504 out of 512 means sync aggregates are still 98.4% strong — more than sufficient for the protocol. But the drift direction matters: three ghost validators in one committee period, drawn at random from a pool of permanent absentees that was always going to include some, is how an edge becomes a blind spot.</p>
<p>The protocol-level fix for this is validator inactivity penalties eventually forcing exit of validators who have been offline for extended periods. That process is working — it's just slow. The genesis-era validator ghost rate of 6.33% reflects validators who have been offline long enough to miss their sync committee duties but not yet long enough to have been ejected.</p>
<p>Worth cross-checking: if the full 30-day ghost rate is 10 genesis-era ghosts across 158 committee appearances, and sync committee membership rotates roughly every 22 months per validator, that implies roughly 158 unique genesis-era validators appeared in sync committees over 30 days out of a remaining genesis-era active set of some number. The 6.33% ghost rate means about 1 in 16 of the genesis-era validators still in the active set are effectively permanently offline but still collecting sync committee duty assignments.</p>
<p>One in sixteen. Showing up on the roll. Signing nothing.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Buried in the USDT contract source code is a comment that reads: <em>"additional variables for use if transaction fees ever became necessary."</em> Beneath it: <code>basisPointsRate = 0</code> and <code>maximumFee = 0</code>. Both initialized to zero. Never changed. The fee mechanism was coded in 2017 in case Tether ever wanted to charge for transfers. They never did.</p>
<p>But the code that reads those variables runs on every USDT transfer. And USDT transfers happen in virtually every Ethereum block.</p>
<p>Here's what that looks like in the raw execution trace data. Querying <code>canonical_execution_storage_reads</code> — a table that records every storage slot accessed during block execution — against 30 days of mainnet history:</p>

<p>The result is stark. USDT's four core storage slots — owner address (slot 0), basisPointsRate (slot 3), maximumFee (slot 4), and a deprecation flag (slot 10) — are present in <strong>79,743 out of 79,743 blocks</strong>. Not 99.9%. Not 99.99%. Every single block in the window.</p>
<p><strong>5.1 million reads of the deprecation flag. 5.0 million reads of the fee rate. 5.0 million reads of the fee cap. All returning zero.</strong></p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="USDT storage hotspot chart" src="https://aubury.org/assets/images/usdt-universal-hotspot-c85ad613fc7440dd7de4bd087a585099.png" width="2461" height="1459" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>The read intensity column tells the rest: <strong>64 reads per block</strong> of the deprecation slot, <strong>62–63 reads per block</strong> of the fee slots. That's roughly 62 USDT transfers happening per block, every block, each one checking the same three parameters before proceeding.</p>
<p>The check isn't optional. The USDT <code>transfer</code> function always calls <code>calcFee</code>, which reads <code>basisPointsRate</code> and <code>maximumFee</code>, computes <code>fee = (value × basisPointsRate) / 10000</code>, and caps it at <code>maximumFee</code>. Since both inputs are zero, fee is zero. The transfer proceeds, fee-free, as it has since 2017.</p>
<p>The cost isn't zero, though. Under EIP-2929, a cold SLOAD costs 2,100 gas. Each USDT transfer starts fresh — no warm cache carries over between transactions — so it pays for three cold reads on the fee slots: roughly <strong>6,300 gas per transfer just to confirm the fee is nothing</strong>. Across 62 transfers per block and 7,200 blocks per day, that's about <strong>2.7 billion gas per day</strong> spent on this confirmation. Equivalent to roughly 45 full Ethereum blocks of capacity, daily, answering the same question with the same answer.</p>
<p>USDC is almost as universal, appearing in 99.99% of blocks with ~42 reads per block. But USDC's pattern is different: it's a proxy contract, and two of its hot slots (<code>0x7050...</code> and <code>0x10d6...</code>) are mapping-derived addresses — almost certainly the token balances of specific high-volume DeFi addresses (major Uniswap pools or similar) being read constantly by routing logic. Those slots change frequently as liquidity moves. The USDT fee slots never change at all.</p>
<p>The Uniswap V3 USDT/ETH pool (identified as <code>0xc7bbec68...</code> on Etherscan) adds another tier: present in 91.8% of blocks, with 3.9 reads per block. This is its pool state slot — the packed struct containing the current price, tick, and liquidity — read whenever any transaction needs the current exchange rate for routing. Dynamic, meaningful data.</p>
<p>Then there's the USDT fee slots: static, zero-valued, and inescapable.</p>
<p>This has a practical consequence for any parallel EVM scheme. Optimistic parallelism works by speculatively executing transactions simultaneously and detecting conflicts after the fact. Two transactions that read but never write the same slot can usually coexist — no conflict. But transactions that both read <em>and</em> write the same slot must be serialized. USDT fee slots are read by every USDT transfer and never written — they're pure read-only at this point, which is actually fine for parallelism. The deeper bottleneck is the per-validator balance slots, the <code>isBlacklisted</code> mapping, and other USDT state that IS written per-transfer. But the fee slots illustrate a broader point: <strong>specific storage locations in Ethereum don't just have high access frequency — they have structural, inescapable access frequency</strong> that no optimization can route around without redeploying the contract.</p>
<p>Tether can't upgrade USDT without migrating all liquidity, integrations, and institutional custody arrangements. The fee mechanism is permanent. So is the gas it consumes.</p>
<p>Every block, somewhere between 60 and 65 Ethereum transactions ask: "Is the USDT fee rate non-zero?" Every block, the EVM reads the answer from storage and says: no.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[Reth validates blocks in 35ms. Erigon takes 200ms. Besu is slowing down. And a new Rust client called ethrex is right on Reth's heels — with nightly builds and one monitoring node.]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Every 12 seconds, your execution client gets a new block and has to tell the consensus layer: valid or not. The call is <code>engine_newPayload</code>, and how long it takes determines how fast your validator can attest to the new head.</p>
<p>That window matters. A faster EL client means earlier head votes, better attestation accuracy, and more flexibility in how you run your validator. The timing game, MEV extraction, and late block handling all happen inside this gap.</p>
<p>So which execution client is fastest? The data is messier than the win-rate leaderboards suggest.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_Vzrq" id="what-the-data-actually-shows">What the data actually shows<a href="https://aubury.org/blog/2026/02/27/el-validation-race#what-the-data-actually-shows" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to What the data actually shows" title="Direct link to What the data actually shows" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<p>The ethpandaops monitoring network records every <code>engine_newPayload</code> call from its fleet of sentry nodes — each running one EL client. That's tens of thousands of raw observations per day per client, enough to compute real median validation times.</p>

<p>Across the six clients tracked over the last month, the picture is striking.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="EL validation race" src="https://aubury.org/assets/images/el-validation-race-92f7ee2f403fc0e192e9bf18f1755ef5.png" width="1458" height="918" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>Three tiers emerge clearly on the log scale:</p>
<table><thead><tr><th>Client</th><th>30-day p50</th><th>Change</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Reth</td><td>40ms avg, <strong>35ms now</strong></td><td>↓ 25%</td></tr><tr><td>ethrex</td><td>41ms avg, <strong>37ms now</strong></td><td>↓ 16%</td></tr><tr><td>Nethermind</td><td>45ms avg, <strong>~48ms now</strong></td><td>↓ 7%</td></tr><tr><td>Geth</td><td>75ms avg</td><td>stable</td></tr><tr><td>Besu</td><td>156ms avg, <strong>171ms now</strong></td><td>↑ 15%</td></tr><tr><td>Erigon</td><td>210ms avg, range 171–301ms</td><td>volatile</td></tr></tbody></table>
<p>The gap is substantial. At the 95th percentile, Erigon takes over a second to validate blocks that Reth processes in under 100ms.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_Vzrq" id="reths-monthly-sprint">Reth's monthly sprint<a href="https://aubury.org/blog/2026/02/27/el-validation-race#reths-monthly-sprint" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Reth's monthly sprint" title="Direct link to Reth's monthly sprint" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<p>Reth went from 47ms to 35ms p50 over these 30 days — a 25% improvement that happened in two steps. The first step came around Feb 9–10, when development builds in the 1.10.2 series dropped from 47ms to around 34ms. The second step came when 1.11.0-dev builds started appearing on Feb 13, pushing median time to the 31–32ms range.</p>

<p>The old 1.9.3 nodes — still running in the monitoring fleet on unchanged hardware — consistently show 41–50ms. The newer 1.11.1 builds run at 29–31ms. Same machine, same blocks, different software: a 36% gap between two adjacent version families.</p>
<p>This is what rapid iteration through nightly development builds looks like in validation timing data.</p>

<p>There's a sixth execution client in the raw xatu data that doesn't appear on any major "client diversity" leaderboard yet: <strong>ethrex</strong>, built by Lambda Class in Rust.</p>

<p>One monitoring node, a new build almost every day. The version string changes daily (<code>9.0.0-17f0f3bf</code>, <code>9.0.0-7839747f</code>, etc. — each one a fresh nightly commit). And the performance tells a story: ethrex started at 44ms p50 in late January and has been tracking Reth downward since, landing at 35–37ms over the last week.</p>
<p>At this level of performance, ethrex is already competitive with production Reth. It's been running on mainnet, it's getting faster, and the trajectory closely mirrors Reth's. Whether it expands beyond one monitoring node is the next question.</p>

<p>There's a popular way to benchmark EL client speed: count how many slots each client "wins" — i.e., for each block, which client type was fastest to return VALID.</p>

<p>Nethermind wins 68% of blocks. Reth wins 28%. But we just established that Reth is actually faster than Nethermind in absolute terms (35ms vs 50ms median).</p>
<p>The reason: the win rate measures how often any node of that client type was fastest. If the monitoring fleet has 56 Nethermind nodes and 23 Reth nodes, Nethermind has 2.4× more shots at the fastest response in any given slot. The best of 56 Nethermind observations will often beat the best of 23 Reth observations, even if the underlying Reth nodes are individually faster.</p>
<p>Win rates measure "how many nodes you have × how fast they are." Median validation time measures just how fast. They're different things, and only one of them matters for your individual validator.</p>
<p>Today (Feb 27), Reth and Nethermind have reached rough parity on win counts — the first time Reth has matched Nethermind's pace in these 30 days. This is a monitoring-fleet-composition story as much as a software story.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_Vzrq" id="besu-is-moving-in-the-wrong-direction">Besu is moving in the wrong direction<a href="https://aubury.org/blog/2026/02/27/el-validation-race#besu-is-moving-in-the-wrong-direction" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Besu is moving in the wrong direction" title="Direct link to Besu is moving in the wrong direction" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<p>The outlier on the downside is Besu. Its median validation time has climbed from 141ms in early February to 171ms today — a 15% deterioration over three weeks.</p>
<p>The p95 picture is worse. Besu's 95th percentile went from around 280ms (Jan 28) to over 700ms (Feb 14), then settled back to ~600ms. If you're a validator running Besu, your EL is taking 4–5× longer than Reth to validate a typical block, and your tail latency is substantial.</p>
<p>For regular attestation on most slots, this still isn't catastrophic — attestations happen at t=4s and Besu usually finishes well before then. But for timing-game blocks that arrive at t≈2–3s, an extra 130ms of EL processing can be the difference between a head vote and a missed one.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_Vzrq" id="what-this-means-in-a-slot">What this means in a slot<a href="https://aubury.org/blog/2026/02/27/el-validation-race#what-this-means-in-a-slot" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to What this means in a slot" title="Direct link to What this means in a slot" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<p>At 35ms, Reth processes a full block in 0.3% of a 12-second slot. At 210ms, Erigon is using 1.7% of the slot just on block validation.</p>
<p>Neither is catastrophic in isolation. The timing game research has shown validators don't attest until t≈4s regardless — so a 35ms vs 200ms EL gap isn't directly causing missed attestations most of the time.</p>
<p>Where it matters:</p>
<ol>
<li class="">
<p><strong>Late arriving blocks</strong> — when a proposer publishes at t=3.5s (timing game), the CL gets the block and calls <code>engine_newPayload</code> immediately. An Erigon validator has ~8.5s remaining for that call to complete and attestation to propagate. A Reth validator has ~8.5s but with 170ms less pressure.</p>
</li>
<li class="">
<p><strong>Block building</strong> — execution clients also validate their own local builds. Faster validation means fresher block content before the deadline.</p>
</li>
<li class="">
<p><strong>Tail risk</strong> — the p95/p99 matters more than the median when you're running thousands of validators. Erigon's p95 at 400–800ms means one in twenty blocks takes a substantial chunk of your attestation window.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The race is happening at the millisecond level. And over the last 30 days, Reth has been running it harder than anyone.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[Every Ethereum full node carries 296 GB of state. 88% of it hasn't been accessed in over a year. And the single largest consumer isn't USDT — it's XEN Crypto.]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Every full Ethereum node is currently lugging around <strong>296 GB of state</strong>. Every account, every contract, every storage slot. Sync a fresh node and you're downloading all of it. Run a node continuously and you're holding all of it in your database, forever.</p>
<p>The uncomfortable truth: the vast majority of that state is dead. It hasn't moved in over a year. The addresses are abandoned, the contracts are deprecated, the protocols are gone. The data just... sits there. In every node on the network.</p>
<p>Here's what the top 15 contracts look like when you sort by total storage slots and ask: how much of this has actually been touched in the last 12 months?</p>

<p>That narrow cyan sliver on the left — that's the active portion. Everything else is dormant.</p>

<p>Global total: <strong>2.4 billion storage slots</strong>. Of those, <strong>2.12 billion</strong> — 88.3% — haven't been touched in a year.</p>
<p>The state size data confirms: 296 GB total state as of late February 2026, growing at roughly 200 MB per day. Storage trie nodes alone account for 221 GB of that — the overhead of the Patricia Merkle Trie that makes every slot globally verifiable.</p>

<p>Not USDT. Not USDC. Not WETH. Not Uniswap. <strong>XEN Crypto</strong>, a viral zero-premine token launched in October 2022, has the most storage of any contract on mainnet — 196 million slots.</p>

<p>XEN's storage footprint is larger than USDT and USDC <em>combined</em> (172M). Why?</p>
<p>XEN's mechanism was simple: call <code>claimRank()</code> with any wallet, get a minting rank, come back later to claim tokens. One call = one storage slot in XEN's mapping. The contract went viral in late 2022, driven by an arms race of bots and retail minters all trying to claim early ranks. Ethereum's state grew by XEN's adoption curve — one slot per wallet, no exceptions.</p>
<p>Ethereum has 364 million accounts in total. XEN's 196 million storage slots represent interactions from roughly <strong>54% of all Ethereum accounts ever created</strong>. Not all of those are humans — many are bot farms that spun up thousands of fresh wallets to game rank ordering — but the storage is real and permanent either way.</p>
<p>Of those 196 million slots, 61.7% are now dormant. The other 38% are technically "active" by the 365-day standard, which likely reflects read traffic from portfolio trackers and aggregators checking balances rather than actual economic activity in the contract.</p>
<p>USDT (#2 with 121.7M slots) is <strong>81% dormant</strong>. These are token holders who haven't moved their USDT in over a year. Diamond hands, or more likely: lost wallets, dead addresses, exchange cold storage that never touches individual slots.</p>

<p>Some of these contracts aren't just dormant — they're fully abandoned. Every single storage slot, untouched.</p>
<p><strong>Forsage.io</strong> — rank 5, 26.5 million slots, 100% expired. Forsage was a Ponzi scheme built on Ethereum smart contracts, viral in 2020-2021, eventually prosecuted by the SEC. The scheme is gone. The storage remains.</p>
<p><strong>OpenSea Wyvern v1 and v2</strong> — ranks 4 and 6, 31.6M and 19M slots combined, both 100% expired. OpenSea deprecated Wyvern in 2022 in favor of Seaport. Every NFT order, every cancelled listing, every filled bid — frozen in state forever.</p>
<p><strong>Seaport (OpenSea v3)</strong> — rank 7, 17.3M slots, also 100% expired. OpenSea has since moved to even newer contracts.</p>
<p><strong>IDEX</strong> — rank 9, 14.6M slots, 100% expired. One of the early decentralised exchanges. Most of its users migrated elsewhere years ago.</p>
<p><strong>Axie Infinity: Ronin Bridge</strong> — 10.8M slots, 100% expired. The bridge that was drained for $625 million in March 2022. Since replaced. The original contract's state just sits in every node's database.</p>
<p><strong>CryptoKitties</strong> — 8.9M slots, 99.4% expired. The 2017 NFT game that famously congested Ethereum. Long since faded. Each kitty's traits and ownership data still occupies a node somewhere.</p>
<p><strong>EtherDelta</strong> — 9.4M slots, 100% expired. The first meaningful DEX on Ethereum, peaked in 2017-2018, hacked in 2017, effectively dead by 2019.</p>
<p>These aren't edge cases. They're in the top 15 by total storage. They persist because Ethereum has no mechanism to reclaim storage from abandoned contracts. SSTORE costs gas to write and nothing to hold. Once a slot exists with a non-zero value, it stays until that same slot is explicitly overwritten with zero.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_Vzrq" id="even-the-active-protocols-are-mostly-dormant">Even the active protocols are mostly dormant<a href="https://aubury.org/blog/2026/02/27/ethereum-state-graveyard#even-the-active-protocols-are-mostly-dormant" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Even the active protocols are mostly dormant" title="Direct link to Even the active protocols are mostly dormant" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<p>WETH: 12.1 million slots, <strong>70% expired</strong>. The token that wraps ETH is one of the most traded assets on Ethereum. Still, 70% of WETH holders haven't moved their position in over a year.</p>
<p>Uniswap v3 NonfungiblePositionManager: 11.8M slots, <strong>85.5% expired</strong>. These are liquidity positions in Uniswap v3. Most LPs haven't touched their positions in a year — either they closed out and the slot was zeroed, or they're long-term holders who set and forgot.</p>
<p>Permit2 (Uniswap's token approval contract): 16.9M slots, <strong>84.2% expired</strong>. Permit2 stores approval records per token per spender per owner. Most approvals were granted once and never revisited.</p>
<p>The pattern is consistent. Even for protocols in active use, the overwhelming majority of their state is stale. USDT processes billions of dollars in transfers every day, yet 81% of the addresses that ever held USDT haven't moved in a year.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_Vzrq" id="what-this-means-for-the-state-expiry-debate">What this means for the state expiry debate<a href="https://aubury.org/blog/2026/02/27/ethereum-state-graveyard#what-this-means-for-the-state-expiry-debate" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to What this means for the state expiry debate" title="Direct link to What this means for the state expiry debate" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<p>State expiry proposals — like the historical ones around EIP-4444, EIP-7736, and various "state rent" discussions — argue that nodes shouldn't have to store data indefinitely that nobody is using.</p>
<p>The argument usually sounds theoretical. These numbers make it concrete.</p>
<p>If a state expiry mechanism existed that could prune slots not accessed in 12 months, the 2.4 billion slot universe would shrink to roughly <strong>280 million active slots</strong> (11.7% of current). The storage trie — which accounts for the majority of state size due to Merkle overhead — would compress dramatically alongside it.</p>
<p>This is also the data behind why state sync time for new nodes is measured in hours: the node has to validate and store all 296 GB regardless of whether 88% of it will ever be needed again.</p>
<p>For now, every node holds it all. EtherDelta, Forsage, and XEN's armies of minting bots included.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[Ethereum's block capacity doubled from 30M to 60M gas in 2025 through three coordinated validator actions. No hard fork. No governance vote. Just 1.1 million validators updating their config files.]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ethereum's block gas limit doubled in 2025. Not through a hard fork. Not through a governance vote. Through three coordinated waves of validators updating their configuration files.</p>
<p>The limit went from 30 million to 60 million gas—a 100% increase in block capacity—between February and November 2025. Each wave moved faster than the last. The final surge, from 45M to 60M, took just 22 hours.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_Vzrq" id="what-actually-happened">What actually happened<a href="https://aubury.org/blog/2026/02/27/gas-limit-doubling#what-actually-happened" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to What actually happened" title="Direct link to What actually happened" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<p>The gas limit is set by validators. Each block proposer signals their preferred limit in the block header. The actual limit drifts toward the median preference, moving at most 1/1024 of the current value per block.</p>
<p>This mechanism allows gradual changes without protocol upgrades. But what we saw in 2025 was not gradual.</p>
<p><strong>Wave 1: February 4-6, 2025</strong></p>
<p>For over a year, the limit held steady at 30M. Then on February 4, it jumped to 34.9M. By February 6, it stabilized at 36M. A 20% increase in 48 hours.</p>

<p><strong>Wave 2: July 21-22, 2025</strong></p>
<p>After months at 36M, the limit jumped again. From 37M to 44.9M in two days. This was a 25% increase.</p>
<p><strong>Wave 3: November 24-26, 2025</strong></p>
<p>The big one. The limit went from 45M to 60M—a 33% increase—in just 22 hours.</p>
<p>The first block to push above 46M was at slot 13097935, proposed by <strong>Binance</strong> at 15:47:23 UTC on November 24. Within hours, Lido, Coinbase, Bitfinex, and solo stakers joined. By November 26 at 02:00 UTC, the network had converged on 60M.</p>

<p>This is EIP-1559 working as designed. The base fee adjusts to maintain equilibrium at 50% utilization. When the limit goes up, the base fee drops, demand increases, and blocks fill back to the target.</p>
<p>But here's what actually changed: <strong>absolute throughput doubled</strong>. At 30M limit, blocks used ~15M gas. At 60M limit, blocks use ~30M gas. The network processes twice as many transactions per block, at lower base fees.</p>

<p>What makes this remarkable is how it happened. There was no on-chain vote. No core dev announcement. No DAO proposal.</p>
<p>Validators simply updated their <code>--gas-limit</code> flags (or equivalent configuration). When enough did so simultaneously, the network followed.</p>
<p>The acceleration is striking:</p>
<ul>
<li class=""><strong>Feb 4-6</strong>: 3 days for 30M → 36M</li>
<li class=""><strong>Jul 21-22</strong>: 2 days for 37M → 45M</li>
<li class=""><strong>Nov 25-26</strong>: 22 hours for 45M → 60M</li>
</ul>
<p>Each wave was faster, suggesting validators learned from the previous rounds. The coordination mechanism is informal—Twitter discussions, Discord channels, staking provider internal decisions—but the effect is binding.</p>
<p>This is governance without governance. A $300 billion network changed its most critical economic parameter three times in one year, and the only record is in the block headers.</p>

<p>The CBT table <code>fct_execution_gas_limit_signalling_daily</code> reveals current validator preferences. While 60M is now the overwhelming majority (~860K observations/day), a persistent minority signals 36M (~66K/day) and a handful signal 100-120M (~500-600/day).</p>

<p>The 36M faction represents validators who either never updated from the pre-November configuration or are actively pushing to reduce the limit. The 100-120M signals are validators testing or advocating for further increases.</p>

<p>Ethereum's gas limit is its most important economic parameter. It determines:</p>
<ul>
<li class="">How many transactions fit in a block</li>
<li class="">How much state growth occurs</li>
<li class="">What hardware is required to run a node</li>
<li class="">Who can afford to participate</li>
</ul>
<p>The fact that this can change by 100% in 22 hours, without any protocol upgrade, reveals both the flexibility and the fragility of the system.</p>
<p>On one hand, Ethereum can adapt quickly to demand. When L2s need more blob space, when DeFi activity surges, the network can respond.</p>
<p>On the other hand, a coordinated action by major staking providers (Lido, Coinbase, Binance) could theoretically move the limit to any value within days. There are no hard bounds—only the soft constraint of social consensus.</p>
<p>The data shows this is not theoretical. It happened three times in 2025. And it will happen again.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[Lighthouse says depth-1. Prysm says depth-2. Same event, same block hashes. What's going on inside Ethereum's consensus clients?]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ethereum had 660 chain reorganizations in the last 30 days. That's a 0.31% reorg rate across roughly 216,000 slots — normal background noise for a live PoS network.</p>
<p>But here's something nobody talks about: if you ask Lighthouse how deep those reorgs were, you'll get a completely different answer than if you ask Prysm. Same event. Same block hashes. Different depth. Every single time.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_Vzrq" id="the-finding">The finding<a href="https://aubury.org/blog/2026/02/27/reorg-depth-client-split#the-finding" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to The finding" title="Direct link to The finding" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<p>At every reorg event, the beacon API emits a <code>chain_reorg</code> event containing the slot, the <code>old_head_block</code>, the <code>new_head_block</code>, and the <code>depth</code> — how many blocks were reorganized.</p>
<p>I pulled 30 days of these events from the ethpandaops xatu dataset, across six consensus clients: Lighthouse, Grandine, Prysm, Lodestar, Teku, and Tysm. To filter out noise, I identified <strong>314 "consensus reorg" slots</strong> — moments where at least three different client types all agreed that <code>depth &gt;= 2</code> had occurred.</p>

<p>Lighthouse and Grandine report depth-1. Everyone else reports depth-2. This is not statistical noise. It holds in 99% of events across an entire month.</p>

<p>The obvious question: are these clients even looking at the same event?</p>
<p>Yes. I checked <code>old_head_block</code> and <code>new_head_block</code> for a specific event at slot <strong>13769249</strong> (Feb 25, 21:30 UTC):</p>

<p>Every client reported the same <code>old_head_block</code>: <code>0x7152e91...</code>. And Lighthouse, Grandine, Lodestar, and Teku all agreed on the same <code>new_head_block</code>: <code>0x40de3ae...</code>. But Lighthouse said depth-1. Lodestar and Teku said depth-2.</p>
<p>Same source. Same destination. Different depth. That's only possible if the clients are measuring from different reference points.</p>
<p>The most likely explanation: Lighthouse and Grandine emit the <code>chain_reorg</code> event <strong>after</strong> updating their internal head state. By the time the event fires, they've already adopted the new chain — and from their updated perspective, the reorg was only 1 slot. Prysm and Lodestar fire the event from their <strong>old</strong> head position, where the reorg looks like 2 slots.</p>
<p>Neither is "wrong" in a broken sense. But they're measuring different things and calling them the same field.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_Vzrq" id="tekus-follow-on-events">Teku's follow-on events<a href="https://aubury.org/blog/2026/02/27/reorg-depth-client-split#tekus-follow-on-events" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Teku's follow-on events" title="Direct link to Teku's follow-on events" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<p>There's a third behavior, unique to Teku.</p>
<p>At 220 slots over the past 30 days, Teku emitted a <code>chain_reorg</code> event with <code>depth &gt;= 3</code> — at a slot <strong>after</strong> the main reorg had already been reported. No other client emitted anything for those same slots.</p>
<p>Here's the pattern from slot 13769249 through 13769251 (events 12 seconds apart):</p>
<div class="language-text codeBlockContainer_Ckt0 theme-code-block" style="--prism-color:#F8F8F2;--prism-background-color:#282A36"><div class="codeBlockContent_QJqH"><pre tabindex="0" class="prism-code language-text codeBlock_bY9V thin-scrollbar" style="color:#F8F8F2;background-color:#282A36"><code class="codeBlockLines_e6Vv"><span class="token-line" style="color:#F8F8F2"><span class="token plain">Slot 13769249  (21:30:11): All clients — reorg at depth 1-2</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#F8F8F2"><span class="token plain">Slot 13769250  (21:30:23): Lodestar + Teku — depth-3</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#F8F8F2"><span class="token plain">Slot 13769251  (21:30:35): Teku only — depth-4</span><br></span></code></pre></div></div>
<p>The chain had reorganized. Most clients processed it in one slot. Teku kept revising its depth estimate for 24 more seconds — emitting fresh depth-3 and then depth-4 events as it continued reconciling its internal state with the new canonical chain.</p>
<p>This isn't a Teku bug per se. It may reflect a more conservative internal reconciliation loop — Teku doesn't commit to the final reorganization picture until it's fully processed. But it does mean that if you're using chain_reorg events to alert on deep reorgs, a Teku-based monitor will fire alarms that no other client would trigger.</p>

<p>There's a second layer to this.</p>
<p>In <strong>315 of 660 reorg slots</strong> (47.7%), Prysm and Tysm briefly adopted a <em>different</em> <code>new_head_block</code> than the other four clients. Not just a different depth — an entirely different block hash.</p>

<p>The split is consistent: <strong>Prysm + Tysm</strong> on one fork, <strong>Lighthouse + Grandine + Lodestar + Teku</strong> on another — nearly half the time a reorg occurs.</p>
<p>This likely reflects a tie-breaking difference in LMD-GHOST. When two valid blocks compete for the same slot, different clients may score them differently based on their view of recent attestations. Prysm and Tysm appear to consistently prefer one competing block; the other four clients prefer the other.</p>
<p>The chain eventually settles, and the data here is from monitoring nodes (not validators) — so this doesn't directly affect consensus. But it does mean that during the ~12 seconds a fork is contested, the network has two distinct client camps holding different views of the canonical head.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_Vzrq" id="what-this-means-for-monitoring">What this means for monitoring<a href="https://aubury.org/blog/2026/02/27/reorg-depth-client-split#what-this-means-for-monitoring" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to What this means for monitoring" title="Direct link to What this means for monitoring" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<p>If your Ethereum monitoring stack runs Lighthouse nodes, you're seeing a different chain than Prysm operators see. Not in terms of finalized blocks — both will converge there — but in terms of how much turbulence occurred in the last few slots.</p>
<p>A Lighthouse monitor reports 99% of reorgs as depth-1: "minor, one block reshuffled."</p>
<p>A Prysm monitor reports those same events as depth-2: "two blocks reorganized, attestations may have been orphaned."</p>
<p>Neither knows the other is reading the same event differently.</p>
<p>The practical impact is real for anyone building reorg alerting, SLA dashboards, or health metrics on top of beacon API events. You can't just look at the <code>depth</code> field and assume it's client-agnostic. You need to know who reported it.</p>
<p>The depth discrepancy exists because the beacon API spec doesn't pin down <em>when</em> relative to internal state the <code>chain_reorg</code> event must be emitted. That ambiguity has accumulated into a 99% consistent split between two implementation families — one that reads "1", one that reads "2", and a third that keeps updating for 24 seconds.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>One validator missing an attestation isn't a crisis. A few hundred validators missing 1 in 8 attestations, every slot, for three months straight — that's a different story. And it's concentrated in a way that the aggregate participation numbers don't show.</p>
<p>The xatu dataset tracks missed attestations at the entity level. When you sort by miss rate, a clear hierarchy emerges — and a handful of operators sit far outside the expected range.</p>

<p>Professional operators anchor the bottom of the range. Kraken, p2porg, Coinbase, and the major Lido node operators all cluster below 0.4% miss rate — essentially noise. These entities have dedicated infrastructure with redundancy; they don't miss attestations absent something unusual.</p>
<p>Solo stakers run at 1.2–2.1% consistently, depending on the week. This includes the broad category of independent home validators and self-hosted setups — people running nodes on personal hardware with some care taken. Occasionally a solo validator goes offline; the aggregate stays low.</p>
<p>Rocket Pool sits a bit higher, ranging from 1.5% to 6% over the same window. The variability reflects the distributed nature of the protocol: independent node operators with varying infrastructure quality, and no central quality floor. The December 2025 spike to 6% likely reflects a client update or network issue that hit less-maintained nodes harder before resolving.</p>
<p>Then there's Avado.</p>
<p>Avado is a plug-and-play validator device — proprietary hardware preloaded with node software, marketed as a simple way to stake ETH at home. The liveness data shows a validator population that has been missing roughly 1 in 9 to 1 in 14 attestations for the entire 90-day observation window. Not occasionally. Every week.</p>
<div class="language-text codeBlockContainer_Ckt0 theme-code-block" style="--prism-color:#F8F8F2;--prism-background-color:#282A36"><div class="codeBlockContent_QJqH"><pre tabindex="0" class="prism-code language-text codeBlock_bY9V thin-scrollbar" style="color:#F8F8F2;background-color:#282A36"><code class="codeBlockLines_e6Vv"><span class="token-line" style="color:#F8F8F2"><span class="token plain">Query: same table, entity = 'avado'</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#F8F8F2"><span class="token plain">Week of Nov 23: 15.3% miss</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#F8F8F2"><span class="token plain">Week of Dec 28: 8.75% (improving)</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#F8F8F2"><span class="token plain">Week of Jan 25 (Pectra week): 7.88% (best in window)</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#F8F8F2"><span class="token plain">Week of Feb 1: 7.52%</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#F8F8F2"><span class="token plain">Week of Feb 8: 9.55% (regression begins)</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#F8F8F2"><span class="token plain">Week of Feb 22: 12.74%</span><br></span></code></pre></div></div>
<p>The trajectory is a partial improvement followed by a regression. Avado started at 15% miss rate in late November, improved steadily through December and January — likely due to software updates or churn of the worst-performing nodes exiting — then ticked back up after Pectra activation, and hasn't recovered. Current miss rate is now higher than any week since early December.</p>
<p>Compare this to DAppNode, a product serving a nearly identical market: software that turns consumer hardware into an Ethereum node. DAppNode validators run at a 1.5–2.2% miss rate in the same window. They had their own rough patch in December (briefly hitting 6%), but they recovered. The gap as of February is roughly six-fold: 12.7% for Avado against ~2.2% for DAppNode.</p>
<p>This difference is significant. At 12.7% miss rate, an Avado validator earns roughly 87% of its maximum possible attestation rewards. At 2.2%, a DAppNode validator earns ~97.8%. Compounded over a year, the performance gap costs Avado stakers around a third of their potential returns compared to a well-run setup. For context, the entire beacon chain APY is around 3–5%; losing 11 percentage points of attestation performance erases years of compounding benefit.</p>
<p>The mechanism is not obvious from outside. Both Avado and DAppNode run the same Ethereum clients. The difference could be hardware constraints (Avado ships fixed-spec devices that may be under-resourced for current state growth), software maintenance cycles (Avado's OS and firmware may update less frequently), or user behaviour (Avado users may be less likely to actively monitor and maintain their setups).</p>
<p>Whatever the cause, the data is consistent across 90 days and hundreds of thousands of attestation slots. This is structural.</p>
<p>There's also the Lido CSM data, which deserves its own attention. Several Lido Community Staking Module operators show miss rates between 8% and 42% over the same window:</p>
<div class="language-text codeBlockContainer_Ckt0 theme-code-block" style="--prism-color:#F8F8F2;--prism-background-color:#282A36"><div class="codeBlockContent_QJqH"><pre tabindex="0" class="prism-code language-text codeBlock_bY9V thin-scrollbar" style="color:#F8F8F2;background-color:#282A36"><code class="codeBlockLines_e6Vv"><span class="token-line" style="color:#F8F8F2"><span class="token plain">Query: same table, WHERE entity LIKE 'csm%'</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#F8F8F2"><span class="token plain">csm_operator17_lido:  100% miss (offline entirely)</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#F8F8F2"><span class="token plain">csm_operator260_lido: 41.8% miss</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#F8F8F2"><span class="token plain">csm_operator286_lido: 39.8% miss</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#F8F8F2"><span class="token plain">csm_operator345_lido: 11.8% miss</span><br></span></code></pre></div></div>
<p>The CSM allows permissionless participation: operators bond ETH and run validators. The low barrier to entry creates a wide quality spread. Most CSM operators in the data are at 1–4% miss rate — reasonable. But the tail includes operators who are apparently either completely offline or running on very unstable infrastructure. The 100%-miss CSM operator has been logging missed attestations for weeks without exiting.</p>
<p>The network-level impact of all of this is modest. Avado has roughly 400–450 validators; CSM's worst performers are smaller still. Total staked ETH in the Avado fleet is probably under 15,000 ETH. The aggregate participation rate barely blinks.</p>
<p>But that's the wrong frame. The question isn't whether the network is healthy — it clearly is. The question is whether home stakers, who are supposed to be the long-term decentralization base of Ethereum, are actually able to run reliable infrastructure. Avado's data says: not reliably, not right now. DAppNode's says they can, with the same hardware profile.</p>
<p>The gap is there. It's been there for three months. And it's widening.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There's a counterintuitive pattern buried in Ethereum's block-building data: the most valuable blocks — the ones where MEV extractors collect the most ETH — consistently contain <em>fewer</em> transactions than ordinary blocks.</p>
<p>Not slightly fewer. Significantly fewer.</p>
<p>A block worth 0.2–1 ETH in MEV carries, on average, <strong>185 transactions</strong>. A normal low-MEV block carries <strong>293</strong>. That's 108 fewer transactions — a 37% drop from peak — in a block that everyone in the market fought hardest to produce.</p>
<p>And gas utilization barely moves. Premium-MEV blocks use ~48% of available gas capacity vs. ~53% for ordinary blocks. Which means the transactions they <em>do</em> include are not simpler — they're <strong>44% heavier</strong> per transaction on average (189K gas/tx vs. 132K for normal-tier blocks).</p>

<p>The drop is sharpest at the "high" tier (&gt;0.05 ETH): transaction count falls by 54 in one step, and gas per transaction jumps by 24%. Cross into the premium tier and you shed another 27 transactions while adding another 15% to gas-per-tx. The block is emptier but heavier per slot.</p>

<p>The pattern is driven by a specific split in how block builders behave.</p>
<p>I ran a builder-level breakdown asking: when Builder X captures a premium-MEV block (&gt;0.2 ETH), how does it compare to their own normal blocks?</p>

<p>The result splits cleanly into two groups.</p>
<p><strong>Sparse builders</strong> — Builder C (<code>0xb26f...</code>, 7,213 blocks/week, market leader) and Builder E (<code>0x88857...</code>, 4,059 blocks/week):</p>
<table><thead><tr><th></th><th>Premium blocks</th><th>Normal blocks</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Avg tx</td><td>135 / 149</td><td>235 / 251</td></tr><tr><td>Avg gas/tx</td><td>189K / —</td><td>132K / —</td></tr><tr><td>Gas utilization</td><td>42–46%</td><td>43–50%</td></tr></tbody></table>
<p>When Builder C captures a premium MEV event, it builds a block with <strong>100 fewer transactions</strong> than its own normal blocks. Gas-per-tx jumps 44%. Total gas barely changes. It's not building bigger blocks — it's building sparser ones with heavier payloads.</p>
<p><strong>Dense builders</strong> — a cluster of builders (prefixes <code>0x851b</code>, <code>0x853b</code>, <code>0x850b</code>, <code>0x855b</code>) that consistently fill their blocks to 62–64% regardless of MEV value:</p>
<table><thead><tr><th></th><th>Premium blocks</th><th>Normal blocks</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Avg tx</td><td>308–349</td><td>337–357</td></tr><tr><td>Gas utilization</td><td>58–71%</td><td>62–64%</td></tr></tbody></table>
<p>These builders win fewer premium blocks overall (22–44 vs. 104 for Builder C) but their block-filling behavior doesn't change based on MEV value. They pack the block the same way whether it's a 0.01 ETH block or a 1 ETH block.</p>
<p>The dominant extractors — the ones that win the most premium slots — are also the ones that leave the most unclaimed space in those slots.</p>

<p>Why does Builder C build sparse blocks when it captures high-value MEV?</p>
<p>The most likely explanation is <strong>time pressure combined with bundle constraints</strong>.</p>
<p>High-value MEV opportunities are time-sensitive: a large liquidation, a cross-DEX arbitrage, a token-launch sandwich. Builder C finds the opportunity, constructs the bundle, and needs to submit the block before another builder does. There's limited time to sort through thousands of pending mempool transactions and append them after the bundle.</p>
<p>More importantly, MEV bundles often require <strong>strict transaction ordering</strong>. Adding mempool transactions after a sandwich bundle risks execution-order conflicts that could invalidate the bundle entirely. Builders may be intentionally conservative about what they append.</p>
<p>The transactions that <em>do</em> make it in — 135 on average — are the high-value, pre-curated ones. Each consumes 44% more gas than a typical transaction because they're complex DeFi operations: multi-hop swaps, liquidation calls, delegate-call chains. But at 135 transactions × 189K gas, you've only used ~25M of the 60M gas limit. The rest sits unclaimed.</p>
<p>You can verify this wasn't caused by the timing game (late-publishing blocks). When I joined with block propagation data, timing-game blocks (Wave 3, &gt;2.8s) actually had <em>more</em> transactions (298) and <em>higher</em> gas utilization (55%) than Wave 1 blocks — the opposite of the premium-MEV pattern. The sparseness is specific to high-value events, not a propagation artifact.</p>

<p>Premium MEV events aren't uniformly distributed across the day.</p>

<p>UTC 01:00 (US 8 PM EST) had <strong>3.36%</strong> premium blocks — the highest of any hour, 65 premium blocks across 1,936 total.</p>
<p>UTC 22:00 had <strong>zero</strong>. Not one premium block across 1,946 slots. The DeFi MEV market effectively shuts down for that hour.</p>
<p>The UTC 14:00–15:00 window (US morning session) was the second-highest concentration at 2.39–2.76%. These two peaks — US evening and US morning — map directly to DeFi trading liquidity windows. MEV opportunities are downstream of activity; where traders are active, MEV searchers follow.</p>

<h2 class="anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_Vzrq" id="the-scale">The scale<a href="https://aubury.org/blog/mev-sparseness-paradox#the-scale" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to The scale" title="Direct link to The scale" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<p>Over 14 days, there were <strong>950 premium-tier blocks</strong> (&gt;0.2 ETH). On average, each premium block used <strong>4.15 Mgas less</strong> than a comparable normal block would have.</p>
<p>950 blocks × 4.15 Mgas = <strong>3.94 billion gas</strong> left on the table.</p>
<p>At 60M gas per block, that's roughly <strong>65 full blocks worth of transaction capacity</strong> sacrificed over two weeks because the builders capturing the highest-value MEV events didn't have the time or incentive to fill the remaining space.</p>
<p>In absolute terms that's small — 65 blocks across 14 days barely registers against ~100,000 total blocks. But it reveals something structural about how the MEV-Boost block-building market works: the blocks that generate the most value for validators and builders are also the ones that deliver the least to users competing for block space.</p>
<p>The dense builders (<code>0x851b</code> family) prove it doesn't have to be this way. They maintain 62–64% gas utilization even on their premium slots. But they win a small fraction of premium blocks because they likely don't have the MEV extraction infrastructure to compete at the top of the value curve.</p>
<p>High-value MEV and full blocks appear to be in tension. The builders best equipped to capture one are systematically less inclined to deliver the other.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>One month after Pectra went live, roughly 44% of all Nethermind validator nodes are rejecting a blob retrieval call that was introduced in that very fork. Every other major execution client has mostly fixed this. Nethermind hasn't moved.</p>
<p>This is the data on what's happening, why it matters, and where the fault line sits.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_Vzrq" id="what-engine_getblobsv2-does">What engine_getBlobsV2 does<a href="https://aubury.org/blog/nethermind-blob-blindspot#what-engine_getblobsv2-does" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to What engine_getBlobsV2 does" title="Direct link to What engine_getBlobsV2 does" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<p>Pectra (activated January 25, 2026) added a new Engine API call: <code>engine_getBlobsV2</code>. The idea is simple — when a consensus client receives a new block containing blob commitments, it asks its execution client: <em>"do you have these blobs in your local cache?"</em> The EL, which participates in the blob P2P network independently, should already have them. The CL can then verify blob availability without touching the P2P layer itself.</p>
<p>If the EL says "I don't have it" — or worse, "I don't support this call" — the CL has to fall back and fetch all blobs itself from peers. With typical blocks carrying 5–6 blobs (post-Pectra target), that's a non-trivial fallback.</p>
<p>The <code>UNSUPPORTED</code> status code specifically means the EL doesn't implement the method at all. It returns in ~1 ms with zero blobs. That's not a cache miss — it's a blank stare.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_Vzrq" id="nethermind-stuck-at-44-since-day-one">Nethermind: stuck at 44% since day one<a href="https://aubury.org/blog/nethermind-blob-blindspot#nethermind-stuck-at-44-since-day-one" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Nethermind: stuck at 44% since day one" title="Direct link to Nethermind: stuck at 44% since day one" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<p>The ethpandaops infrastructure has been monitoring <code>engine_getBlobsV2</code> calls since shortly after Pectra launched. The pattern for Nethermind validator (non-builder) nodes is stark.</p>
<div class="language-text codeBlockContainer_Ckt0 theme-code-block" style="--prism-color:#F8F8F2;--prism-background-color:#282A36"><div class="codeBlockContent_QJqH"><pre tabindex="0" class="prism-code language-text codeBlock_bY9V thin-scrollbar" style="color:#F8F8F2;background-color:#282A36"><code class="codeBlockLines_e6Vv"><span class="token-line" style="color:#F8F8F2"><span class="token plain">Query: fct_engine_get_blobs_by_el_client</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#F8F8F2"><span class="token plain">Filter: node_class = '', mainnet, Jan 25 – Feb 25, 2026</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#F8F8F2"><span class="token plain">Group: day, meta_execution_implementation, status</span><br></span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>On January 27 — the first full day of monitoring data — Nethermind regular validator nodes showed a <strong>52% UNSUPPORTED rate</strong>. One month later, it's still <strong>41%</strong>.</p>
<p>Every other EL client has converged toward near-zero:</p>
<ul>
<li class=""><strong>Reth</strong> started at 7–14% and is now at ~1%</li>
<li class=""><strong>go-ethereum</strong> dropped from ~16% to ~3%</li>
<li class=""><strong>Erigon</strong> declined from ~22% to ~3%</li>

<p>Nethermind hasn't moved.</p>

<p>Drilling into the raw <code>execution_engine_get_blobs</code> table reveals the version breakdown clearly.</p>
<div class="language-text codeBlockContainer_Ckt0 theme-code-block" style="--prism-color:#F8F8F2;--prism-background-color:#282A36"><div class="codeBlockContent_QJqH"><pre tabindex="0" class="prism-code language-text codeBlock_bY9V thin-scrollbar" style="color:#F8F8F2;background-color:#282A36"><code class="codeBlockLines_e6Vv"><span class="token-line" style="color:#F8F8F2"><span class="token plain">Query: execution_engine_get_blobs</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#F8F8F2"><span class="token plain">Filter: meta_execution_implementation = 'Nethermind', mainnet, 7d</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#F8F8F2"><span class="token plain">Group: meta_execution_version_minor, status</span><br></span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>Nethermind v1.37.x handles blob requests just fine. Nethermind <strong>v1.35.2</strong> — specifically the build tagged <code>1.35.2+faa9b9e6</code> — is responsible for 107,000+ UNSUPPORTED responses in the past week alone. That single build accounts for the majority of Nethermind's blindspot.</p>
<p>The version gap spans at least one minor release cycle. v1.35.x didn't ship <code>engine_getBlobsV2</code> support; v1.37.x did. And a large cohort of validator operators hasn't crossed that boundary in the month since Pectra launched.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_Vzrq" id="builders-know--validators-dont">Builders know — validators don't<a href="https://aubury.org/blog/nethermind-blob-blindspot#builders-know--validators-dont" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Builders know — validators don't" title="Direct link to Builders know — validators don't" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<p>There's a telling split within Nethermind's own ecosystem. The same dataset, filtered by <code>node_class</code>:</p>
<div class="language-text codeBlockContainer_Ckt0 theme-code-block" style="--prism-color:#F8F8F2;--prism-background-color:#282A36"><div class="codeBlockContent_QJqH"><pre tabindex="0" class="prism-code language-text codeBlock_bY9V thin-scrollbar" style="color:#F8F8F2;background-color:#282A36"><code class="codeBlockLines_e6Vv"><span class="token-line" style="color:#F8F8F2"><span class="token plain">Query: fct_engine_get_blobs_by_el_client</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#F8F8F2"><span class="token plain">Filter: mainnet, 7d, meta_execution_implementation = 'Nethermind'</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#F8F8F2"><span class="token plain">Group: node_class, status</span><br></span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>Builder operators — the teams running MEV infrastructure 24/7 — are almost entirely on v1.37.x. They update constantly because being on stale software costs them money.</p>
<p>Validator operators don't have the same forcing function. Many are running solo stakers or smaller services on set-and-forget configurations. A 30-day version gap is normal for that population. The problem is that Pectra introduced a new requirement they don't know they're failing.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_Vzrq" id="the-practical-cost">The practical cost<a href="https://aubury.org/blog/nethermind-blob-blindspot#the-practical-cost" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to The practical cost" title="Direct link to The practical cost" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<p>When a CL is paired with a v1.35.2 Nethermind, every blob-bearing block triggers the following sequence:</p>
<ol>
<li class="">CL sends <code>engine_getBlobsV2</code> → gets <code>UNSUPPORTED</code> in 1 ms</li>
<li class="">CL falls back to P2P blob fetching — independently requesting each blob hash from its gossip peers</li>
<li class="">If blobs are already propagated (usually true), the fetch completes in tens to hundreds of milliseconds</li>
<li class="">If the network is under load, fetches can take longer</li>
</ol>
<p>Most of the time this is a performance cost, not a correctness failure. The CL will eventually get the blobs. But timing matters in Ethereum PoS — attestations must be published within about 4 seconds of slot start, and block processing competes for that same window. Consistently slow blob resolution means consistently slower block processing, which means validators paired with v1.35.2 Nethermind are running slightly more exposed to attestation timing pressure.</p>
<p>At scale, 44% of the Nethermind validator population is a meaningful fraction of the network. It's not catastrophic, but it's a quiet drag that's been running since day one of Pectra.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_Vzrq" id="what-to-do">What to do<a href="https://aubury.org/blog/nethermind-blob-blindspot#what-to-do" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to What to do" title="Direct link to What to do" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<p>If you're running Nethermind as your execution client, check your version:</p>
<div class="language-bash codeBlockContainer_Ckt0 theme-code-block" style="--prism-color:#F8F8F2;--prism-background-color:#282A36"><div class="codeBlockContent_QJqH"><pre tabindex="0" class="prism-code language-bash codeBlock_bY9V thin-scrollbar" style="color:#F8F8F2;background-color:#282A36"><code class="codeBlockLines_e6Vv"><span class="token-line" style="color:#F8F8F2"><span class="token plain"># Nethermind HTTP API</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#F8F8F2"><span class="token plain">curl -s -X POST http://localhost:8545 \</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#F8F8F2"><span class="token plain">  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#F8F8F2"><span class="token plain">  -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"web3_clientVersion","params":[],"id":1}'</span><br></span></code></pre></div></div>
<p>If you see <code>Nethermind/v1.35.x</code>, upgrade. The v1.37.x releases include <code>engine_getBlobsV2</code> support and the UNSUPPORTED rate for those builds is ~3%.</p>
<p>The broader point: Pectra changed more than just blob limits. It added new Engine API surface that older EL versions simply don't implement. Validators who updated their node software before the fork might have been on a version that predated those additions. One month in, that's still showing up clearly in the data.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[0.46% of MEV-Boost blocks captured 47% of all proposer ETH over 30 days. The rewards don't distribute — they storm.]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Most validators proposing a block right now will earn about <strong>0.011 ETH</strong>. That's the median. But the mean is 0.050 ETH — more than 4× higher. The reason the mean is so detached from the median tells you everything about how staking rewards actually work.</p>
<p>Over the 30 days ending February 26, 2026, there were <strong>200,963 MEV-Boost blocks</strong> on mainnet. I deduped them by taking the highest bid per slot across all relays. Here's what I found.</p>

<p>The distribution is a power law so compressed it doesn't fit on a linear axis:</p>
<ul>
<li class=""><strong>p50</strong>: 0.011 ETH</li>
<li class=""><strong>p90</strong>: 0.050 ETH</li>
<li class=""><strong>p95</strong>: 0.090 ETH</li>
<li class=""><strong>p99</strong>: 0.427 ETH</li>
<li class=""><strong>p99.9</strong>: 2.26 ETH</li>
<li class=""><strong>max</strong>: 189 ETH</li>
</ul>
<p>That max-to-median gap is <strong>17,000×</strong>. A proposer who hits slot 13731002 on February 20 earns in a single block what the average validator earns from roughly 1,500 proposals — about 13 years of proposals at one-per-110-days.</p>

<p><strong>917 blocks</strong> — just 0.46% of all 200,963 — captured <strong>47% of all proposer ETH</strong> in the period. The other 99.54% of blocks split the remaining half.</p>
<p>The top 105 blocks (0.052%) each exceeded 10 ETH. Together they captured 2,570 ETH — <strong>26% of the entire month's proposer revenue</strong> from 0.052% of proposals.</p>
<hr>
<p>These aren't randomly distributed. They clump.</p>
<p>January 31 had 119 "storm blocks" (&gt;2 ETH each) worth 1,193 ETH total. But the timing wasn't spread across the day. Between 17:00 and 18:59 UTC, two consecutive hours accounted for roughly 1,050 ETH of that. The preceding 16 hours had been completely normal — typical blocks, typical rewards. Then at 17:00 UTC something happened on-chain, and for two hours dozens of sequential proposers each earned 33–67 ETH instead of 0.01.</p>

<p>By 20:00 UTC, everything was back to normal. A 90-minute window had passed and whoever happened to be scheduled to propose during those slots won a lottery they didn't even know they'd entered.</p>
<p>February 5 had a similar story but different shape — two separate burst windows, one at 15:00 UTC (433 ETH, max 67 ETH) and another at 20:00 UTC (636 ETH, max 65 ETH). The bursts were ~5 hours apart, suggesting two distinct on-chain events rather than one sustained wave. February 6 carried the storm's tail: 679 ETH in the first hour alone (00:00 UTC, max 90 ETH) as activity settled.</p>
<p>The storm pattern makes sense mechanically. When a large on-chain event creates MEV opportunity — a major token launch, a protocol liquidation cascade, a large AMM rebalancing — the opportunity doesn't vanish in one block. Sandwich opportunities in particular span multiple blocks because the same large trade needs time to settle, cascading secondary trades keep flowing, and competing extractors keep bidding aggressively across consecutive slots. So the MEV "wave" propagates forward through several blocks before exhausting itself.</p>
<hr>
<p>What does this mean for a validator?</p>
<p>With ~900,000 active validators, each gets a proposal roughly once every 110 days — about <strong>3.3 proposals per year</strong>. The 0.46% jackpot rate (917 slots &gt;1 ETH out of 200,963 over 30 days) means each proposal has about a <strong>0.46% chance of being a jackpot block</strong>.</p>

<p>Over a year with 3.3 proposals per validator:</p>
<p><strong>P(at least one jackpot in one year) = 1 − (1 − 0.0046)^3.3 ≈ 1.5%</strong></p>
<p>About <strong>1 in 67 validators</strong> will hit a jackpot block in any given year. When they do, the average jackpot pays <strong>5.14 ETH</strong> — around <strong>460× the median block reward</strong> of 0.011 ETH.</p>
<p>That jackpot is worth more than a year of base attestation rewards for most validators. The validator who happened to propose slot 13624886 on February 5 at 20:00 UTC earned 64.6 ETH from a single 12-second window. At a 4% base staking APY on 32 ETH, that's 5 years of attestation rewards — compressed into one slot.</p>
<p>The other 98.5% of validators will finish the year without a jackpot, having earned the median reward of ~0.036 ETH from their three proposals (and most of that comes from the MEV-Boost floor rather than anything exciting). They are not being cheated. The expected value math works out. But the experience of staking is entirely different depending on whether the randomness fell your way.</p>
<hr>
<p>A few things this data doesn't answer.</p>
<p>The storm events are obvious in the reward data but I can't see their cause directly from relay data alone — only that multiple consecutive validators each earned extraordinary rewards from the same ~90-minute window. The most likely mechanism is cascading DeFi activity: a large trade triggers a wave of sandwich opportunities and arbitrage that takes dozens of blocks to settle.</p>
<p>The 30-day sample includes three distinct "storm clusters" — January 31, February 5-6, and February 20 — suggesting roughly <strong>one significant storm every 10 days</strong>. Whether that rate is stable over longer periods, or whether certain on-chain conditions (specific protocols, time of day, market conditions) reliably predict them, is an open question the relay data alone can't resolve.</p>
<p>What it does confirm is that if you think of staking rewards as a predictable income stream, you're modeling the wrong thing. The base attestation yield is predictable. The proposer lottery is not — and it constitutes a large enough share of total staking economics that most validators experience its absence as the normal case, with occasional jackpots distributed across the validator set by chance.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Each blob on Ethereum costs the same regardless of how much data you actually put inside it. The slot doesn't know if you packed all 131,072 bytes or left 99% empty. You pay either way.</p>
<p>That flat pricing creates a question that hasn't been answered cleanly: how efficiently are rollups actually using the space they're buying? The answer turns out to span an enormous range — from 100% fill all the way down to a rollup that's posting the same completely empty blob, over and over, every block.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="Rollup blob fill rate by chain" src="https://aubury.org/assets/images/rollup-blob-fill-rates-8cac9c38c7812ae6696834b8aa1b876f.png" width="1789" height="1355" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<div class="language-text codeBlockContainer_Ckt0 theme-code-block" style="--prism-color:#F8F8F2;--prism-background-color:#282A36"><div class="codeBlockContent_QJqH"><pre tabindex="0" class="prism-code language-text codeBlock_bY9V thin-scrollbar" style="color:#F8F8F2;background-color:#282A36"><code class="codeBlockLines_e6Vv"><span class="token-line" style="color:#F8F8F2"><span class="token plain">Query: ethpandaops xatu — canonical_beacon_blob_sidecar × mainnet.dim_block_blob_submitter</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#F8F8F2"><span class="token plain">Method: per versioned_hash, match blob_empty_size to rollup address via dim table</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#F8F8F2"><span class="token plain">Window: Feb 19–26, 2026 (7-day average, mainnet)</span><br></span></code></pre></div></div>
<p>Most of the chart is green. That's the story for the largest rollups — StarkNet, Arbitrum, Unichain, OP Mainnet, Soneium, Base — all packing their blobs at 96–100%. When you post 5–6 blobs per transaction and batch until they're full, you end up near capacity almost automatically. These chains have figured out the right posting cadence.</p>
<p>Then the bottom of the chart starts getting uncomfortable.</p>
<p><strong>Mantle</strong> fills its blobs at 32.5%. Every blob transaction it sends contains roughly one-third useful data and two-thirds zeros. It posts ~1,240 blobs per week — if it batched to full capacity, it would need about 400.</p>
<p><strong>Katana</strong> is at 15.5%. One blob per transaction, roughly 1 in 6.5 bytes of actual data.</p>
<p><strong>Taiko</strong> comes in at 8.8% fill across three batcher addresses, totaling 1,072 blobs per week. The useful data in those 1,072 blobs would fit comfortably in about 94 full blobs. Taiko is posting 11× more often than it needs to.</p>
<p><strong>Metal</strong> is 0.56% fill.</p>
<p>That number deserves a pause. Each Metal blob holds an average of ~730 bytes of actual data inside a 131,072-byte envelope. The waste ratio against Arbitrum — which fills its blobs at 99.8% — is roughly 178×. Metal posts 2,452 blobs per week and transfers about 1.3 MB of useful data. If it packed blobs fully, that's fewer than 11 blobs.</p>
<p>The cost math is simple: blob gas is priced per blob, not per byte. A rollup with 0.56% fill is paying per byte as if 131 KB of data had the same cost as the actual ~730 bytes. That's not theoretical waste — it's blob fees going out the door.</p>
<p>The mechanism behind these gaps isn't mysterious. Rollups that post at 97–100% are the ones that accumulate data until they've collected enough to fill multiple blobs, then batch everything in one transaction. When you post 3 blobs, you have 393 KB to fill. If your chain has enough throughput to generate that data between posting intervals, you'll be near capacity.</p>
<p>Rollups that post 1 blob per block every block — Metal, Taiko, Katana, Mantle — don't wait. Whatever data has accumulated since the last post goes out immediately, regardless of how little it is. For high-traffic chains, that's fine; the data fills up fast. For lower-throughput chains, it means paying full blob cost for a fraction of the space.</p>
<p>The Aztec case is different. Aztec posts exactly one blob per transaction, once per block, at 0% fill — not 0.56%, literally zero useful bytes. More unusual: every single Aztec blob transaction in the past week uses the <strong>same versioned hash</strong>.</p>
<div class="language-text codeBlockContainer_Ckt0 theme-code-block" style="--prism-color:#F8F8F2;--prism-background-color:#282A36"><div class="codeBlockContent_QJqH"><pre tabindex="0" class="prism-code language-text codeBlock_bY9V thin-scrollbar" style="color:#F8F8F2;background-color:#282A36"><code class="codeBlockLines_e6Vv"><span class="token-line" style="color:#F8F8F2"><span class="token plain">Query: dim_block_blob_submitter WHERE address = '0x7342404...'</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#F8F8F2"><span class="token plain">→ 1,284 transactions, unique_first_hashes = 1</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#F8F8F2"><span class="token plain">→ versioned_hash = 0x010657f37554c781402a22917dee2f75def7ab966d7b770905398eba3c444014</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#F8F8F2"><span class="token plain">→ blob_size = 131072, blob_empty_size = 131072 (all zeros)</span><br></span></code></pre></div></div>
<p>A versioned hash is derived from the KZG commitment to the blob's content. Identical hash means identical content — all zeros, every time. Aztec appears to be posting a canonical null blob as a protocol heartbeat, maintaining sequencer liveness on-chain even when no user transactions are pending. Whether this is an intentional design or a configuration artifact isn't clear from the chain data, but the pattern is consistent across 1,284 blocks last week.</p>
<p>The efficiency divergence between rollups isn't hidden — it's just not usually visualized this way. The blob market looks like one thing from the outside (flat-rate pricing, relatively cheap, widely adopted) but is doing very different economic work for different chains underneath. Chains that wait to batch full pay roughly the same fee per byte as chains that don't. The difference accrues over thousands of weekly blobs.</p>
<p>For Taiko at 8.8% fill, upgrading to a batching strategy that targets 80% fill would reduce their blob spend by roughly 90% while publishing exactly the same data. The blobs exist either way — it's a question of whether you fill them before paying.</p>
